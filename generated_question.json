(“the Company”) provided in the “Financial Information” section in the company’s Annual Securities Report, which comprise the balance sheet as at March 31, 2023 and the statement of income and statement of changes in net assets for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies, other explanatory information and supplementary schedules, in accordance with Article 193-2(1) of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and its financial performance for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are\nKey Audit Matter\nA key audit matter is a matter that, in our professional judgment, was of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter.\nIn our audit of the financial statements of the current period, we continued to include the key audit matter for the prior period audit, “Reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates” as the key audit matter for the current period.\n", "\nReasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\nThe key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\nDaiwa Securities Group Inc. (the “Company”), as a holding company of a comprehensive securities group, holds large amounts of shares of subsidiaries and associates. The Company recognized shares of subsidiaries and associates of ¥628.6 billion and an allowance for investment losses of ¥4.1 billion on the balance sheet as at the end of the current fiscal year. Shares of subsidiaries and associates include shares without market prices the Company acquired at a price that reflect future excess earning power. To assess the reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates, we primarily performed the following audit procedures: (1) Internal control testing\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the Company’s internal controls relevant to the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates. In this assessment, we focused our testing on the following controls:\nAs described in the Note, “Significant accounting policies, 1 Valuation standards and methods for major assets” to the financial statements, shares of subsidiaries and associates are valued at cost based on the moving average method in the balance sheet. If the substantive value of the subsidiaries and associates has declined significantly, an impairment loss shall be recognized unless its recoverability is supported by sufficient evidence. In addition, as described in the Note, “Significant accounting policies, 3 Accounting policies for provisions” to the financial statements, even if any impairment loss is not eventually recognized, to prepare for losses arising from the shares of subsidiaries and associates, the Company provides an allowance for investment loss in an amount equivalent to a decline in the substantive value of the shares, taking into consideration of their actual situation. •\n\ncontrols to ensure that the internal rules for the\nvaluation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\ncomply with accounting standards and other applicable\nrequirements; and\n• controls to ensure that the substantive value of shares of subsidiaries and associates by considering whether the excess earning power reflected is reasonable.\n(2) Assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\nIn order to evaluate the reasonableness of judgments on recognizing an impairment loss or an allowance for investment loss on shares of subsidiaries and associates with declining substantive value, we assessed the extent to which a loss had been incurred, as well as whether there was sufficient evidence supporting recoverability. This assessment included the following audit procedures:\nThe amount of shares of subsidiaries and associates accounts for a certain percentage (approximately 27%) of the total assets. In addition, the measurement of excess earning power, which is taken into consideration in the calculation of the substantive value, and assessment of recoverability of the substantive value based on business plans includes judgment by management, which may have a significant impact on the financial statements. • Evaluation of the operating status and excess earning power of subsidiaries and associates\nIn order to understand the operating status of the subsidiaries and associates and to revaluate the excess earning power reflected in their acquisition costs, we inspected materials used in management’s evaluation of the operating status, including results of the analysis on the status of achievement of their business plans and the causes of the difference between the plan and actual results, and the appropriateness of business improvement measures. In addition, we assessed the reasonableness of management’s evaluation of shares of subsidiaries and associates by inspecting an evaluation report from an external valuation company and performing an analysis based on publicly available information on the industry trends of subsidiaries and associates we independently obtained. We, therefore, determined that our assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates was of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly, a key audit matter.\nOther Information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Securities Report, but does not include the financial statements, the financial statements, and our auditor’s reports thereon. Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the other information. The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the directors’ performance of their duties with regard to the design, implementation and maintenance of the reporting process for the other information.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230919OTHRHAIP_Daiwa Securities Co., Ltd._20230919121938_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [24, 27]}

Completion and submission of the instrument appointing a proxy or proxies by a member will not prevent him/her from\nattending, speaking and voting at the AGM if he/she so wishes. The appointment of a proxy or proxies for the Meeting shall be deemed to be revoked if the shareholder attends the AGM in person, and in such event, the Company reserves the right to refuse to admit any person or persons appointed under the relevant instrument appointing a proxy or proxies, to the AGM.\n4.

{"question": "What is the key audit matter for Daiwa Securities Group Inc.?", "answer": "The reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates.", "raw_text": "What is the key audit matter for Daiwa Securities Group Inc.?\n###ANSWER:\nThe reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates.", "pages": ["\nReasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\nThe key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\nDaiwa Securities Group Inc. (the “Company”), as a holding company of a comprehensive securities group, holds large amounts of shares of subsidiaries and associates. The Company recognized shares of subsidiaries and associates of ¥628.6 billion and an allowance for investment losses of ¥4.1 billion on the balance sheet as at the end of the current fiscal year. Shares of subsidiaries and associates include shares without market prices the Company acquired at a price that reflect future excess earning power. To assess the reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates, we primarily performed the following audit procedures: (1) Internal control testing\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the Company’s internal controls relevant to the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates. In this assessment, we focused our testing on the following controls:\nAs described in the Note, “Significant accounting policies, 1 Valuation standards and methods for major assets” to the financial statements, shares of subsidiaries and associates are valued at cost based on the moving average method in the balance sheet. If the substantive value of the subsidiaries and associates has declined significantly, an impairment loss shall be recognized unless its recoverability is supported by sufficient evidence. In addition, as described in the Note, “Significant accounting policies, 3 Accounting policies for provisions” to the financial statements, even if any impairment loss is not eventually recognized, to prepare for losses arising from the shares of subsidiaries and associates, the Company provides an allowance for investment loss in an amount equivalent to a decline in the substantive value of the shares, taking into consideration of their actual situation. •\n\ncontrols to ensure that the internal rules for the\nvaluation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\ncomply with accounting standards and other applicable\nrequirements; and\n• controls to ensure that the substantive value of shares of subsidiaries and associates by considering whether the excess earning power reflected is reasonable.\n(2) Assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\nIn order to evaluate the reasonableness of judgments on recognizing an impairment loss or an allowance for investment loss on shares of subsidiaries and associates with declining substantive value, we assessed the extent to which a loss had been incurred, as well as whether there was sufficient evidence supporting recoverability. This assessment included the following audit procedures:\nThe amount of shares of subsidiaries and associates accounts for a certain percentage (approximately 27%) of the total assets. In addition, the measurement of excess earning power, which is taken into consideration in the calculation of the substantive value, and assessment of recoverability of the substantive value based on business plans includes judgment by management, which may have a significant impact on the financial statements. • Evaluation of the operating status and excess earning power of subsidiaries and associates\nIn order to understand the operating status of the subsidiaries and associates and to revaluate the excess earning power reflected in their acquisition costs, we inspected materials used in management’s evaluation of the operating status, including results of the analysis on the status of achievement of their business plans and the causes of the difference between the plan and actual results, and the appropriateness of business improvement measures. In addition, we assessed the reasonableness of management’s evaluation of shares of subsidiaries and associates by inspecting an evaluation report from an external valuation company and performing an analysis based on publicly available information on the industry trends of subsidiaries and associates we independently obtained. We, therefore, determined that our assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates was of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly, a key audit matter.\nOther Information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Securities Report, but does not include the financial statements, the financial statements, and our auditor’s reports thereon. Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the other information. The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the directors’ performance of their duties with regard to the design, implementation and maintenance of the reporting process for the other information.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230919OTHRHCW4_Daiwa Securities Group Inc._20230919111452_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [9, 12]}

For a more detailed explanation, please refer to “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects－Reconciliation with Japanese GAAP” in the annual report on Form 20-F filed on June 29, 2021 (Eastern Daylight Time).\nScope of Consolidation (Item 1)\n\n | Under IFRS, the Group consolidates an entity when it “controls” the entity. In general, the Group considers that it   controls an entity when it has the existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the operating and financing   policies by owning more than half of the voting power, or by legal or contractual arrangements.\n | All types of entities, irrespective of their purpose or legal form, are consolidated under IFRS when the substance   of the relationship between the entities and the Group indicates that the entities are controlled by the Group.   Therefore certain entities such as securitization vehicles which are not consolidated under Japanese GAAP are   consolidated under IFRS.\n", "Derivative financial instruments (Item 2)\n\n(Hedge accounting)\nThe Group applies hedge accounting under Japanese GAAP. However, the qualifying criteria for certain hedge accounting under IFRS are more rigorous than those under Japanese GAAP. Therefore, except for fair value hedge accounting and hedge accounting for net investments in foreign operations the Group applies under IFRS, the effects of hedge accounting under Japanese GAAP have been reversed under IFRS.\nInvestment securities (Item 3)\n\n(Fair value measurement of investment securities)\nUnder Japanese GAAP, stocks and financial instruments similar to stocks that are not traded in an active market, such as unlisted stocks, are measured at cost if they are classified as available-for-sale, whereas, under IFRS, those are measured at fair values determined by using valuation techniques.\n(Changes in fair value of investment securities)\n\n | Under Japanese GAAP, the changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized in other   comprehensive income and subsequently transferred to profit or loss on their disposal. Under IFRS, the Group   made an irrevocable election for some equity instruments to present subsequent changes in fair value in other   comprehensive income. The changes in fair value of those equity instruments presented in other comprehensive   income are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss.\n | Some available-for-sale financial assets under Japanese GAAP, including investment funds, are classified as   financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, and therefore the changes in their fair values are   recognized in profit or loss under IFRS.\nLoans and advances (Item 4)\n\n(Impairment of loans and advances)\n\n | Under Japanese GAAP, the allowance for loan losses is calculated based on credit assessments at the end of the   reporting period. A collective allowance is calculated using historical loss experience based on historical results   according to the obligor grade, adding forward looking information as appropriate. The allowance for specifically   identified significant loans is calculated by the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method, which is based on the   present value of reasonably estimated cash flows discounted at the original contractual interest rate of the relevant   loan. For the remaining loans, an individual allowance is calculated based on the estimated uncollectible amount   considering historical loss experience and the recoveries from collateral, guarantees and any other collectible cash   flows.\n | Under IFRS, measurement of expected credit losses (“ECL”) depends on whether the credit risk on the financial   asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. If there is not a significant increase in credit risk on that   financial asset since initial recognition, an allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit   losses. Otherwise, an allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The allowance   for loan losses for individually significant impaired loans is calculated by the DCF method based on the present   value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate, which differs   from the calculation of the DCF method under Japanese GAAP. The scope of loans that are subject to the DCF   method under IFRS is wider than that under Japanese GAAP. ECL are measured in a way that reflects not only   past events, but also current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n(Loan origination fees and costs)\nUnder Japanese GAAP, loan origination fees and costs are generally recognized in the consolidated income statement as incurred. Under IFRS, loan origination fees and costs that are incremental and directly attributable to\n", "\nthe origination of a loan are deferred and thus, included in the calculation of the effective interest rate.\nDeferred tax assets (Item 9)\nUnder IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. For example, deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences relating to impairment of financial instruments of which the timing of the reversal is difficult to estimate cannot be recognized under Japanese GAAP, whereas they can be recognized under IFRS to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available.\nClassification of equity and liability (Item 11)\nUnder IFRS, a financial instrument or its component parts are classified as equity instruments or financial liabilities in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liabilities and equity instruments. A financial instrument is classified as a financial liability if there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset other than a fixed number of equity shares in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset. In the absence of such a contractual obligation, the financial instrument is classified as an equity instrument.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG210630OTHR017V_Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc._20210630134356_00_GA_4Q_20210701.1.pdf", "page_number": [3, 6]}

The above increases were partially offset by the decrease in (i) exploration, evaluation and development assets of US$1.49M mainly due to reclassification to oil and gas properties in FY2023; and (ii) other property, plant and equipment of US$0.03M due to an increase in depreciation charges.\nThe Group’s current assets decreased by US$0.62M, from US$5.01M as at 30 June 2022 to US$4.39M as at 30 June 2023. The decrease was due to (i) the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of US$0.09M (please refer to the explanation of cash and cash equivalents under consolidated statement of cash flows below); and (ii) the decrease in trade and other receivables of US$0.53M due to the partial receipt of the Transaction Amount for the Disposal of Preferred Mart and the decrease in trade receivables of the Group.\nThe Group’s non-current liabilities increased by US$0.63M, from US$36.29M as at 30 June 2022 to US$36.92M as at 30 June 2023. This was mainly due to (i) the increase in provision for restoration costs in relation to the Thailand Operations of US$0.8M; and (ii) the recognition of lease liabilities of US$0.006M as a result of a new office lease. The abovementioned was partially offset against the decrease in deferred tax liabilities of US$0.18M in relation to the Thailand Operations.\nThe Group’s current liabilities increased by US$1.11M, from US$2.44M as at 30 June 2022 to US$3.55M as at 30 June 2023. This was mainly due to (i) the increase in trade and other payables of US$1.08M, largely attributable to the increase in working capital loan, accruals, other payables and management fee payable to the main operator and the 60% interest holder of the Thailand Operations; and (ii) the recognition of lease liability of US$0.18M as a result of a new office lease. The increase was partially offset against (i) the repayment of the Thailand HSBC loan of US$0.11M in relation to Thailand Operations in July 2022; and (ii) the decrease in income tax payables of US$0.04M in relation to the Thailand Operations.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nThe Group generated net cash of US$0.78M from its operating activities in FY2023, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of US$0.04M in FY2022. The Group recorded operating cash inflows before working capital changes of US$0.29M. The main movements of the cash flows from operating activities in FY2023 comprised (i) the decrease in trade and other receivables of US$0.11M; and (ii) the increase in trade and other payables of US$0.56M. Income tax of US$0.17M was paid in FY2023.\nThe Group used net cash of US$1.10M for its investing activities in FY2023. This was due to (i) the additions to oil and gas properties of US$0.02M as a result of the evaluation work performed in relation to the Thailand Operations; and (ii) the additions to other property, plant and equipment of US$1.51M, partially offset by the deposit from disposal of Preferred Mart of US$0.42M and proceeds from sales of investment securities of approximately US$7K.\nThe Group generated net cash of US$0.23M from its financing activities in FY2023. This was due to drawn down of a loan facility of US$0.50M, partially offset by (i) repayment of lease liability amounting to US$0.17M; and (ii) repayment of bank borrowings of US$0.11M in relation to the Thailand Operations.\nAs a result of the above, cash and cash equivalents decreased by US$0.09M from US$1.41M as at 1 July 2022 to US$1.32M as at 30 June 2023.\n10.

This was mainly due to the changes in working capital, which resulted in higher net cash inflows from operating activities during the year.\nThe net cash used in investing activities for FY2023 was higher than the last year by S$1.7 million mainly due to the effects of foreign currency re-alignment on investing activities and higher capital expenditure, offset by higher proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment.\nThe net cash flows used in financing activities for FY2023 increased by S$1.0 million as compared to last year mainly due to higher proceeds from bank loans.\nOverall, the Group’s cash and cash equivalent as at 31 March 2023 of S$18.4 million was higher by S$2.4 million as compared to 31 March 2022.\nF7 Where a forecast, or a prospect statement, has been previously disclosed to shareholders, any variance between it and the actual results.\nThe results are consistent with the commentary of the last period.\nF8 A commentary at the date of the announcement of the significant trends and competitive conditions of the industry in which the group operates and any known factors or events that may affect the group in the next reporting period and the next 12 months.\nDespite the global easing of COVID-19 measures and transition to endemic stage, our Group continues to face challenges in the operating environment. Rising operating costs due to broad- base inflationary pressures caused by pandemic disruptions to global supply chains, the geo- political conflict and sanctions, and interest rates hikes to fight inflation are factors impacting the Group’s financial performance. Foreign exchange volatility and manpower constraints even as economies Notwithstanding this, the Group’s revenue matched the previous year’s performance.\nre-opened in the reporting period compounded the Group’s challenges.\nIn the Specialist Relocation segment, the overall revenue contracted marginally despite the severe problems arising from the PRC’s abrupt reversal of COVID-19 measures in December 2022. This caused a spike in local cases of COVID-19 infections and absenteeism of workers disrupted and delayed projects. In addition, the tit-for-tat in visa restrictions (triggered by fear of COVID-19 infected travellers), disrupted the travel of OEM engineers from Japan and South Korea required for equipment commissioning in TFT LCD plants, contributed to a significant decline in revenue and gross profit. However, the endemic-phase re-opening and improved business conditions in the ASEAN countries, particularly with OEMs, helped to lift revenue and gross profits, mitigating challenges faced in the PRC.\nFor 3PL, the overall revenue contracted due to similar challenges faced in the PRC in the abrupt reversal in December and previous Zero COVID-19 policy in the first half of the year resulting in disruptions at the borders driving some customers’ cross-border transportation (\"CBT\") trucking volume back to air & sea freight modes. This resulted in revenue decline to Malaysia, Thailand, and the PRC’s CBT business activities. However, business activities on warehousing, freight- forwarding, and local/long-haul trucking were significantly higher, offsetting the revenue contraction due to the cross-border issues with the PRC.\nIn the Group's T&E segment, the solar installation projects performed strongly on the back of easing foreign labour supply in Singapore, while component and parts manufacturing contributed to a significant upside in revenue. This business segment is well-positioned as it has captured\n", "CHASEN HOLDINGS LIMITED\n(Incorporated in the Republic of Singapore) Company registration number: 199906814G\nmore customers and thus increased market share in the solar panel installation space. The increased scale will position the segment for better margins that is expected to add to the bottom line.\nIn FY2023, the Group saw the fastest interest rate hike by the US Fed in 40 years, which led to foreign exchange volatility, massive layoff in the technology space and preceded a slowdown in the global economy. Notwithstanding this, the Group’s principal strategy and plans remains intact, namely to grow organically by moving up the value chain while diversifying its business to mitigate risks.\nIn the forward period, the Group recognises geo-political developments and trade conflicts couple with supply chains disruption caused by COVID-19 have completely re-shaped the economic landscapes. Far from seeing these developments only as challenges, the Group sees these as opportunities to ascend the value chain and tapped into high growth regional markets in ASEAN and North Asia. The re-shaped landscape has seen companies re-jig and re-configure strategy and manufacturing locations from large-scale single location “just-in-time” inventory to multiple transnational country sites “just-in-case” inventory management. This seismic shift presents strong and sustainable demands to the Groups prospects in the years ahead, in particular, Specialist Relocation and T&E segments.

Not only is this project the world’s largest implementation of Esri Utility Network, it also achieves real-time management and promotes superior network resilience, while being ready to support future energy integration of renewable energy sources: hydro, solar, wind and thermal.\nA Commitment to People Development\nGiven how important geospatial technology has become to data analytics underpinning everything from smart cities to Internet of Things to climate change, promising long- term prospects abound for the sector. Yet, I cannot help but feel that our Geospatial Division’s growth has not matched up with our expectations and more can be done to help the division to achieve a quantum leap to success.\nThe global geospatial sector now faces the challenge of a lack of skilled talent. Customer requirements have become increasingly complex and a capable workforce is needed to keep pace with this change. While there will be growth factors for the sector, a lack of talent will be an impediment to realising its fullest growth potential. Despite the obvious strong demand for geospatial talent, there is no education institution so far that specifically provides geospatial education and training in the Asia Pacific where we operate. This has motivated us to work together with the University of New South Wales (“UNSW”) to develop a geospatial innovation and learning centre that links training to high-impact industry research. We are glad to be partnering with UNSW in this meaningful endeavour, sharing in a commitment to ensuring the long-term success of the industry. Our subsidiary, Esri Australia, a dominant player in the Asia Pacific, is equally committed to driving technological innovation and promoting workforce development together with UNSW.\nOur people have been our greatest asset and the driving force behind our success. This year, I am happy to share that Boustead has, for the third time, been recognised as one of Singapore’s best employers in an extensive survey conducted by Statista and The Straits Times, placing 5th in our category and 155th overall. Separately, Boustead Projects was also awarded the SkillsFuture Employer Award (Gold), an honour given to exemplary employers who are strong advocates of continuous learning and supporters of national manpower objectives.\nA Step Towards a Reunited Boustead Group\nWhen we take a look back at our enduring heritage of close to two centuries, it is clear that Boustead is no stranger to change, having been seasoned by the challenges of wars, economic depressions and recessions, pandemics and the inevitable passage of time. Where we are today can be attributed to an ability to embrace change and adapt to evolving times – attributes that are key to our longevity.\nIn 2015, we distributed Boustead Projects’ shares as a dividend-in- specie and separately listed Boustead Projects for many good reasons. However, over the past eight years, the circumstances and support to separately list Boustead Projects have changed significantly, just like how the business and geopolitical environment have evolved. Increasing compliance and regulatory requirements have mounted on listed corporations over the years, which have led to significant costs, effort and time being expended. The current structure of two separately listed entities has also resulted in a smaller market capitalisation for each, lowering our visibility and limiting our ability to attract sizeable shareholders and to reflect our true value.\n\nThese changes have spurred us to call\nfor a simplified structure that allows\nfor greater control and flexibility in\nthe use of business resources and for\nmanagement to focus on rebuilding the\nbusiness post-pandemic without the\nshortcomings of having two separately\nlisted entities. In February 2023, we launched a voluntary unconditional general offer to consolidate our effective interest in Boustead Projects. Our effective interest in Boustead Projects increased from 54% at the end of FY2022 to 75.5% at the end of FY2023. As a sign that our offer was well received, an overwhelming 82% of available shares was acquired through open market transactions and acceptances at the offer price, which translated to about S$61 million being used to acquire almost 21% of shareholding in Boustead Projects.\nOur intention to delist and privatise Boustead Projects still remains a work in progress. We thank you for your continued support in this and your patience as we explore various options to reach our goal, a reunited Boustead Group that will stand stronger and infuse the progressive agility to withstand the complexities of our evolving world.\nA Word of Appreciation\nI would like to express my deepest gratitude to our management and staff around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions. The past few years have not been an easy time for many, and our steadfast performance has demonstrated the commitment of our team members in the face of adversity.\nI would also like to thank our key stakeholders – clients, business partners, associates, bankers, suppliers, government agencies and you, our fellow shareholders – for your continuous support. I look forward to reconnecting with you in person at our upcoming Annual General Meeting.\nFinally, I wish you and your loved ones, good health and peace.

The Group’s profit after tax translates into a healthy earnings per share of approximately RM0.0479.

This trend potentially benefits the Group as it provides solutions that cater to all types of vegetable oils, including palm oil, soybean oil and rapeseed oil, which are some of the major agricultural commodities in the world. In addition, palm oil is a globally consumed commodity either in the form of edibles such as cooking oil, confectioneries, margarine, and chocolates or as a raw material for ingredients found in a host of non-edible household and industrial products such as soaps, detergents, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Capitalising on this macro trend, the Group will continue to leverage on its capabilities, integrated technology know-how, and proven track record to secure more projects and projects of a larger scale in existing and new markets, and to expand its geographical reach to other markets with emerging prospects.\nThe Group sees an acceleration of the global trend towards environmental sustainability benefitting its Renewable Energy segment as Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producing country, plans to increase the current mandatory 30% blend of palm-based biodiesel requirement in its petroleum diesel. Whilst laboratory testing for biodiesel containing up to 40% of palm-based biodiesel (B40) has been conducted by the government of Indonesia, it continues to implement the raising of mandatory blending of biodiesel from 30% to 35% in the country and will raise it to 40% in the next few years committed to the implementation of its biodiesel programme which will progressively increase biodiesel blending ratios from the current 20%. This expansion will be done in phases based on the readiness of biodiesel blending facilities in Malaysia\n.

With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, initiatives and policies in place, and the growing awareness of the importance of environmental, social and governance considerations, the Group remains optimistic of continued growth prospects in the renewable energy sector. The Group will increase its focus on this sector, and will continue to develop new and innovative processes, and provide more support and solutions to the sustainability efforts of its existing customers and markets.\nBarring any unforeseen circumstances and notwithstanding the uncertainties and volatility of the global economy affected by current geopolitical tensions, the Group expects its businesses to be driven primarily by the corresponding growth in the industries that it serves, with the overall outlook expected to remain positive.\nThe Group started the year 2023 strongly, with new contract wins from Indonesia, Malaysia and Africa.

Both factors acted to restrain overall revenue growth. The Group encountered prolonged supply delays from certain principals and inconsistent lead times from many others during 1H23. Though expected to some degree, the situation was worse than expected. The plan on having a good level of inventory did help to maintain a certain level of momentum but actual stock arrivals turned out to be insufficient to support a stronger pace of growth in 1H23. Supply delays remain an issue. The Group will continue to work closely with principals to try to alleviate issues and improve supply flows. Manpower shortage arising from tight labour market conditions is expected to persist in 2H23. This challenge will continue to have a restraining effect on the Group’s operating capacity and hence on revenue growth.\nAlthough sales objectives in 1H23 were not met, the Group was able to substantially pass on higher product prices to customers during the period resulting in an improved gross margin rate in comparison with the corresponding period last year. Moving forward, the Group will continue to make every effort to maintain the generally improving trendline in gross margin rate in recent years. Combined with the efforts to restrain upward operating cost pressures, the Group aims to build on the operating profit achieved in 1H23.\nDividend information\nCurrent Financial Period Reported on\nAny dividend recommended for the current financial period reported on?

The record profit performance last year provided the additional war chest for the Group to make strategic acquisitions that would add value to its portfolio. These acquisitions are aligned with the Group’s goals to advance its global presence in tandem with its land replenishment strategy in Singapore. In addition, the Group remains focused on extracting value from its current assets while pursuing its fund management ambitions.\nThe business landscape continues to face significant macroeconomic headwinds and vulnerabilities that result in an ambiguous outlook. The market volatility arising from the global economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and interest rate fluctuations will also pose challenges to financing costs and capital investments.\nNavigating these headwinds requires the Group to stay agile, resilient and adaptable. While the Group continues to exercise prudence, vigilance and discipline in capital management, it will maintain a proactive and forward-looking mindset towards growth and expansion. During times of uncertainty, strategic acquisitive opportunities are often prevalent, presenting an opportunity for the Group to bolster its market position, diversify its portfolio and leverage its core expertise for sustainable long-term growth.\n5.
