Certainly! The table structure you've provided is a good starting point for storing a tree structure in PostgreSQL, which is a type of RDS that supports hierarchical data querying using Common Table Expressions (CTEs). Here's a more detailed explanation of how you can use this structure to store and retrieve the node tree data:

1. **Table Structure Explanation:**
   - `chunk_id`: A unique identifier for each chunk, which is the primary key.
   - `parent_chunk_id`: A foreign key that references the `chunk_id` of the parent node. This establishes the parent-child relationship.
   - `pdf_document_name`: The name of the PDF document from which the chunk comes.
   - `chunk_text`: The actual text content of the chunk.
   - `chunk_size`: The size of the chunk, which you are using to determine the level of the node (e.g., 2048, 512, 128).

2. **Inserting Data:**
   When inserting data into the `nodes` table, you would include the `chunk_id` of the parent when adding a child node. If the node is a root node, you could set `parent_chunk_id` to `NULL`.

3. **Retrieving a Subtree:**
   To retrieve all descendants (a subtree) of a specific node, you can use a recursive CTE:

   ```sql
   WITH RECURSIVE subtree AS (
       SELECT chunk_id, parent_chunk_id, pdf_document_name, chunk_text, chunk_size
       FROM nodes
       WHERE chunk_id = 'root_chunk_id'  -- Replace with your root node's ID
       UNION ALL
       SELECT n.chunk_id, n.parent_chunk_id, n.pdf_document_name, n.chunk_text, n.chunk_size
       FROM nodes n
       INNER JOIN subtree s ON s.chunk_id = n.parent_chunk_id
   )
   SELECT * FROM subtree;
   ```

4. **Retrieving Ancestors:**
   To find all ancestors of a node, you use a recursive CTE as well:

   ```sql
   WITH RECURSIVE ancestors AS (
       SELECT chunk_id, parent_chunk_id, pdf_document_name, chunk_text, chunk_size
       FROM nodes
       WHERE chunk_id = 'leaf_chunk_id'  -- Replace with your leaf node's ID
       UNION ALL
       SELECT n.chunk_id, n.parent_chunk_id, n.pdf_document_name, n.chunk_text, n.chunk_size
       FROM nodes n
       INNER JOIN ancestors a ON a.parent_chunk_id = n.chunk_id
   )
   SELECT * FROM ancestors;
   ```

5. **Finding Common Ancestors:**
   If you retrieve two leaf nodes and want to find their closest common ancestor, you can do this:

   ```sql
   WITH RECURSIVE leaf1_ancestors AS (
       SELECT chunk_id, parent_chunk_id
       FROM nodes
       WHERE chunk_id = 'leaf1_chunk_id'  -- Replace with the first leaf's ID
       UNION ALL
       SELECT n.chunk_id, n.parent_chunk_id
       FROM nodes n
       INNER JOIN leaf1_ancestors a ON a.parent_chunk_id = n.chunk_id
   ),
   leaf2_ancestors AS (
       SELECT chunk_id, parent_chunk_id
       FROM nodes
       WHERE chunk_id = 'leaf2_chunk_id'  -- Replace with the second leaf's ID
       UNION ALL
       SELECT n.chunk_id, n.parent_chunk_id
       FROM nodes n
       INNER JOIN leaf2_ancestors a ON a.parent_chunk_id = n.chunk_id
   )
   SELECT DISTINCT a1.chunk_id
   FROM leaf1_ancestors a1
   JOIN leaf2_ancestors a2 ON a1.chunk_id = a2.chunk_id
   ORDER BY a1.chunk_id DESC;  -- Assuming that the root has the lowest chunk_id value
   ```

   This query will return the common ancestors of the two leaf nodes, ordered by their distance from the leaves (with the closest ancestor first).

Remember that with each insertion, update, or deletion, you should maintain referential integrity to ensure that the tree structure remains consistent. Also, when performing recursive queries, be mindful of the performance implications on large datasets and consider using indexes effectively, such as a B-tree index on `chunk_id` and `parent_chunk_id` to speed up these operations.
