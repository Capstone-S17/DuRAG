In particular, it is important to note that it is not possible for the Company to realistically calculate or quantify the impact of purchases or acquisitions that may be made pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate on the NTA per Share and EPS as the resultant effect would depend on the factors such as the aggregate number of Shares purchased, the purchase price paid at the relevant time, and the amount (if any) borrowed by the Company to fund the purchases or acquisitions. The above analysis is based on historical numbers as at 31 March 2023 and is not necessarily representative of future financial performance.\nIt should also be noted that purchases or acquisitions of Shares by the Company pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate would only be made in circumstances where it is considered to be in the best interest of the Company, and the purchases or acquisitions of Shares may not be carried out to the full 10% as mandated. Further, the Directors would emphasise that they do not propose to carry out Share Purchases to such an extent that would, or in circumstances that might, result in a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the Group, or results in the Company being delisted from the SGX\u2011ST. The Company will take into account both financial and non-financial factors (for example, share market conditions and the performance of the Shares) in assessing the relative impact of a Share Purchase before execution.\n2.9 Catalist Rules\nThe Catalist Rules specifies that a listed company shall report all purchases or acquisitions of its shares to the SGX\u2011ST not later than 9.00 a.m.:\n(a) in the case of a Market Purchase, on the Market Day following the day of purchase or acquisition of any of its shares; and\n(b) in the case of an Off-Market Purchase under an equal access scheme, on the second Market Day after the close of acceptances of the offer.\nSuch announcement (which must be in the form of Appendix 8D to the Catalist Rules) must include the details of the date of the purchase, the total number of shares purchased, the number of shares cancelled, the number of shares held as treasury shares, the purchase price per share or the highest and lowest prices paid for such shares, as applicable, and the total consideration (including stamp duties and clearing charges) paid or payable for the shares, the number of shares purchased as at the date of announcement (on a cumulative basis), the number of issued shares excluding treasury shares and the number of treasury shares held after the purchase.\nThe Catalist Rules does not expressly prohibit any purchase or acquisition of its own shares by a listed company during any particular time or times. However, as the Company would be regarded as an \u201cinsider\u201d in relation to any proposed purchase or acquisition of its issued Shares, the Company will not undertake any purchase or acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate at any time after a price-sensitive development has occurred or has been the subject of a decision of the Directors until such time as the price-sensitive information has been publicly announced or disseminated in accordance with the requirements of the Catalist Rules.\nIn particular, the Company would not purchase or acquire any Share through Market Purchases during the period of one (1) month immediately preceding the announcement of the Company\u2019s full-year results and the period of two (2) weeks before the announcement of the first quarter, second quarter and third quarter results of the financial year.\nRule 723 of the Catalist Rules requires a listed company to ensure that at least 10% of any class of its listed securities (excluding treasury shares, preference shares and convertible equity securities) must be held by public shareholders. As at the Latest Practicable Date, approximately 25.72% of the issued Shares are held by public shareholders. Accordingly, the Company is of the view that there is a sufficient number of Shares in issue held by public Shareholders which would permit the Company to undertake purchases or acquisitions of its Shares through Market Purchases up to the full 10% limit pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate without affecting the listing status of the Shares on the SGX\u2011ST, and that the number of Shares remaining in the hands of the public will not fall to such a level as to cause market illiquidity or to affect orderly trading.\n2.10 Reporting Requirements under the Companies Act\nWithin 30 days of the passing of a Shareholders\u2019 resolution to approve any purchase or acquisition of Shares by the Company, the Company shall lodge a copy of such resolution with ACRA. The Company shall notify ACRA within 30 days of a purchase or acquisition of Shares on Catalist or otherwise. Such notification shall include details of the purchase, including the date of the purchase or acquisition, the total number of Shares purchased or otherwise acquired by\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230714OTHRXUIE_Kop Limited_20230714202221_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [36, 39]}, {"question": "Was Ho Shian Ching ever convicted of any offence, in Singapore or elsewhere, involving fraud or dishonesty which is punishable with imprisonment?", "answer": "No", "raw_text": "Was Ho Shian Ching ever convicted of any offence, in Singapore or elsewhere, involving fraud or dishonesty which is punishable with imprisonment?\n###ANSWER:\nNo", "pages": ["\n\nDISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ON\nDIRECTORS SEEKING RE-ELECTION\nName Tang Chun Meng Ho Shian Ching\nDisclose the following matters concerning an appointment of director, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, general manager or other officer of equivalent rank.

Accordingly, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined through the estimation of the expected discounted future cash flows which involves making key assumptions about the sales growth rate, gross profit margin and discount rate.\nDue to significant management judgements and estimates involved in the impairment assessment, we have identified this area to be a key audit matter.\nHow our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\nOur audit procedures included, amongst others, the following:\n\n\u2022\nAssessed management\u2019s determination of whether there is an indication of impairment of the plant and equipment and right-of-use assets of each restaurant outlet.\n\n\u2022\nFor each restaurant outlet with impairment indicators, reviewed and evaluated the key assumptions used in management\u2019s impairment assessment by:\n- Assessing the sales growth rate and gross profit margin in comparison to historical performance and economy outlook.\n- Engaging our internal valuation specialist to evaluate reasonableness of the discount rate applied.\n- Performing sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of changes to the key assumptions on the recoverable amounts, determining they would fall below the carrying amounts of the plant and equipment and right-of-use assets.\n\n\u2022\nAssessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements regarding the impairment assessment.\n", "I NDEP ENDE N T A U D ITO R \u2019 S\nREP ORT\nTo the Members of Japan Foods Holding Ltd.\nOther Information\nManagement is responsible for the other information.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n\u2022\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n\u2022\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.\n\n\u2022\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n", "I NDEP ENDE N T A U D ITO R \u2019 S\nREP ORT\nTo the Members of Japan Foods Holding Ltd.\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.

At the height of the COVID-19 crisis, the strict pandemic measures imposed left deep repurcussions across the built environment (\u201cBE\u201d) sector and significantly affected productivity, at a time that coincided with the execution of our then two largest projects \u2013 JTC Kranji Green and Surbana Jurong Campus. On top of managing severe labour shortages, our E&C Business also endured the challenges of inflation and supply chain disruptions, all of which greatly impacted the margins of projects secured pre-pandemic. To mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic, we proactively embraced construction and real estate technology \u2013 also known as ConTech and PropTech \u2013 to bolster productivity, reduce reliance on labour and keep our team and subcontractors healthy and safe, while establishing ourselves as a leading technology-driven player within the BE sector.\nThe dark clouds of the pandemic have since been lifted for the BE sector and we are heartened to see that our E&C Business turned the corner in FY2023 with construction activities largely returning to normalcy. E&C revenue in 2H FY2023 grew 6% year-on-year to S$160.7 million, a reflection of improved project management and construction management activities. However, E&C revenue for FY2023 was 17% lower year-on-year at S$269.8 million, due to lower revenue contribution in 1H FY2023. Having substantially completed our pre- pandemic backlog following extended pandemic-related delays and with a more manageable cost base, our E&C Business also returned to profitability from a loss position in the prior year. E&C profit before income tax (\u201cPBT\u201d) reached S$10.3 million in FY2023, a decent result given the circumstances although this was nowhere near the levels registered pre-pandemic.\nDespite the multitude of challenges, the pandemic has imparted us with valuable lessons that have strengthened our foundation to better weather any\nstorms ahead. The experience gained has taught us to be more focused and pragmatic in our approach when bidding for new projects, a strategy which we believe will help to better manage resources, mitigate risks and build greater resilience for the business. In the past year, we continued to cautiously rebuild our order backlog in targeted high value-added sectors like pharmaceutical and technology, and went on to secure a total of S$401 million in new contracts. This amount includes a record S$300 million design-and-build contract secured from a repeat Fortune 500 technology client for an integrated manufacturing, logistics and office facility in Singapore. We also secured two contracts in the overseas market of Malaysia, riding on a more established presence there.\nOur Real Estate Business advanced on multiple growth initiatives and platforms, and achieved notable progress in asset class diversification efforts, despite being weighed down by increasing interest rates and property expenses. In FY2023, Real Estate revenue was 3% lower year-on-year\n", "24 Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nLetter to Shareholders\nat S$14.1 million, mainly due to lower rental income following the sale of a subsidiary holding Boustead Industrial Park to a joint venture in Vietnam, a vacant property at 36 Tuas Road due to impending redevelopment, as well as lower non-recurring acquisition and performance fees.\nFollowing the successful acquisition of the mixed development 28 & 30 Bideford Road, a new destination concept was unveiled through an exciting partnership with COMO Group to establish COMO Orchard at the property. Scheduled to open in successive phases, COMO Orchard will house COMO Metropolitan Singapore hotel, a multi-label fashion store, a new wellness space and gourmet concepts by Michelin-starred restaurant chefs which together, will add to the vibrancy of Orchard Road, one of the world\u2019s most recognised boulevards. We expect that the recovery of Singapore\u2019s tourism sector will benefit and be timely for the official opening of 28 & 30 Bideford Road in 2H FY2024.\nIn line with the strategy to scale up through third-party acquisitions, Boustead Industrial Fund (\u201cBIF\u201d), our Real Estate Business\u2019 inaugural full-fledged real estate fund, completed the acquisition of J\u2019Forte Building for S$98.8 million, shortly after the end of FY2023. As BIF\u2019s maiden acquisition in the open market, J\u2019Forte Building \u2013 an eight-floor F&B-focused industrial property at 26 Tai Seng Street \u2013 marks a good addition to the BIF portfolio given its high specifications, prime location, long remaining leasehold land tenure of about 44 years and zoning for food processing operations, which is in limited supply in the area. The injection of J\u2019Forte Building into BIF sets the fund on track for growth not just via the pipeline of sponsor properties but also through third-party acquisitions. Moving ahead, our Real Estate Business will continue to build our development pipeline using a disciplined approach and diversify income streams overseas. At the end of FY2023, BIF had interests in 15 completed properties with a total market valuation of S$690 million, comprising over 195,000 square metres (\u201csqm\u201d) in gross floor area (\u201cGFA\u201d), an overall committed occupancy rate of 98% and weighted average lease expiry (\u201cWALE\u201d) greater than five years.\n#MOVED-TO-PREVIOUS-FLOW\nIn FY2023, we continued to diversify income streams geographically, in particular via the expansion of real estate activities in Vietnam. During FY2023, through our strategic collaboration with Khai Toan Joint Stock Company (\u201cKTG\u201d) and acquisition of KTG & Boustead Joint Stock Company, we launched the flagship KTG & Boustead Industrial Logistics Fund (\u201cKBIL\u201d), our full-fledged private real estate fund in Vietnam, and injected Boustead Industrial Park into KBIL. At the end of FY2023, KBIL had interests in eight completed properties with a total market valuation of S$175 million, comprising over 260,000 sqm in GFA, an overall committed occupancy rate of 76% and WALE greater than two years.\nIn consideration of our improved business performance, your Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.7 cents per share and special dividend of 0.7 cents per share for your approval.\nBuilding Forward\nThe experience gained from COVID-19 has strengthened the foundation of our business for a more resilient future, allowing us to build forward in a future- ready manner. Based on estimates from the Building & Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d), private-sector construction demand is anticipated to reach S$11 billion to S$13 billion in 2023 with the planned development of new high-specification industrial buildings, a level which is comparable with the previous year. Despite the favourable market conditions \u2013 including the lifting of all pandemic restrictions on construction activities \u2013 we remain mindful of the future challenges, including the shortage of skilled labour, growing risk of recession in major economies, supply chain pressures and climate change.\nAs a leading provider of innovative eco-sustainable real estate solutions, we have built an extensive track record in delivering best-in-class industrial developments over the years, setting the benchmark for others in the sector to follow. FY2023 saw the completion of JTC Kranji Green, Singapore\u2019s national landmark project for recycling waste streams. This achievement represents our contribution in advancing Singapore\u2019s vision of a circular economy and Zero Waste Master Plan. We also delivered the Takeda Singapore Biologics Manufacturing Support Facility \u2013 our first ever Green Mark Platinum Positive Energy (\u201cGMP PE\u201d) Building and also Singapore\u2019s first GMP PE in the biomedical and pharmaceutical sector, capable of operating without drawing electricity from the national grid. This positive example of a green building is a blueprint for future-ready buildings that demonstrate climate action and represents a step better than net zero. With 95% of the project\u2019s construction documentation and processes digitalised, this project stands out as a hallmark of technology adoption and a rare achievement in Singapore\u2019s real estate sector.\nMoving ahead, our E&C Business will continue with its current approach of targeting high value-added sectors in the bidding for new projects. Beyond having the expertise and familiarity, these high value-added sectors will offer us the opportunity to readily embrace ConTech and PropTech in project execution, allowing us to\n", "25\nenhance our competitive advantage in this highly competitive sector and reduce dependence on labour. We will also continue to push forward with the implementation of transformative technologies and foster a data-driven culture within the organisation, particularly in improving the quality and speed of decision making through data and data visualisation. Lastly, we will be encouraging building design, construction and operations that fuse a conducive BE for well-being together with technological advancement and clean technology \u2013 also known as CleanTech \u2013 right through the multi- decade building lifecycle.\nAs we continue to play our role in building a more sustainable future, we will gradually raise the sustainability standards of our portfolio, beginning with the certifications for BCA Green Mark Gold and better for properties under the BIF portfolio \u2013 with more in the pipeline. In FY2023, Boustead Projects E&C also achieved a Silver EcoVadis Medal following the rigorous EcoVadis sustainability assessment, a third-party comprehensive evaluation framework that measures and rates the sustainability performance of corporations. EcoVadis has recognised us in the 88th percentile for sustainability among more than 100,000 corporations that they have rated globally. This achievement places us in good stead in our showcase of sustainability efforts, putting us ahead and setting us apart from competition in the sector. In our commitment to address climate change, we will also continue working closely with our CleanTech partners to market the use of industrial solar energy systems and electric vehicle charging stations across our developments.\nJust recently in June 2023, we also announced plans to jointly redevelop our property at 36 Tuas Road in\nSingapore with two other leading real estate players. Upon redevelopment, the property is expected to be a modern five-floor multi-tenanted logistics hub that will cater to the needs of logistics players in the region and is earmarked to attain Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy certification \u2013 one of the first developments to attain this for the logistics and manufacturing sectors under the refreshed BCA Green Mark: 2021.\nAt Boustead Projects, our people are the pillar behind our achievements. On this note, we are pleased to share that we have been conferred the SkillsFuture Employer Award (Gold), an honour given to exemplary employers who are strong advocates of continuous learning and supporters of national manpower objectives. We will continue to invest in training and upskilling every valuable member of the team, building a competent pool of team members that drive our long-term success.\nLooking ahead, there are signs of a weakening of global demand and industrial output amid a volatile interest rate environment and capital markets. Despite a strong backlog and asset base, supported by a healthy balance sheet, we will continue to traverse the road ahead with cautious optimism and prudence, focusing on our key sectors, markets and strengths. Since our listing in 2015, much of the business landscape has evolved, with stronger competition and increasing compliance and regulatory requirements imposed not just on listed corporations but also those operating in the BE sector, leading to greater costs, effort and time being expended. Coupled with the uncertain and volatile times ahead, we recognise the importance of continuing to leverage the combined strengths and synergies of the Boustead Group to enhance our resilience. In February 2023,\nour controlling shareholder, Boustead Singapore Limited (\u201cBSL\u201d), launched a voluntary unconditional general offer for shares that were not owned by BSL and their concert parties. Following this exercise, BSL and their concert parties further consolidated their effective interest in Boustead Projects from 73.98% at the end of FY2022 to 95.5% by the end of FY2023. Our Board understands that BSL continues to explore various options to eventually delist and privatise Boustead Projects according to their stated intentions. Notwithstanding this, Boustead Projects\u2019 senior management team will continue to focus on executing our business strategies as previously articulated to deliver sustainable shared socio-economic value and progress to all our key stakeholders.\nWords of Appreciation\nWe would like to thank our senior leadership and team members for their continued dedication and hard work in building the success of Boustead Projects all these years. We would also like to extend our appreciation to our clients, business partners, associates, bankers, suppliers and our shareholders \u2013 both past and present \u2013 for their support. Last but not least, we would also like to thank our fellow Board colleagues for their wisdom, advice and guidance, especially during the challenging years of the pandemic.\nThank you once again for journeying with Boustead Projects.

This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group\u2019s historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.\nIf credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\n\u2022\nthe borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.\n\n\u2022\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\nMeasurement of ECLs\nECLs are probability-weighted estimates or credit losses. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\nCredit-impaired financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit- impaired. A financial asset is \u2018credit-impaired\u2019 when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n\u2022\nsignificant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due; the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise; it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nPresentation of allowance for ECLs in the statement of financial position\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.\n", "\n\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended 31 March 2023\n3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d) 3.6\nImpairment (cont\u2019d) (i)\nNon-derivative financial assets (cont\u2019d)\nWrite-off\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group\u2019s procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n(ii) Joint venture\nAn impairment loss in respect of a joint venture is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with note 3.6(iii). An impairment is recognised in the statement of total return. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n(iii) Non-financial assets\nThe carrying amounts of the Group\u2019s non-financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (\u201cCGU\u201d) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.\nImpairment losses are recognised in the statement of total return. Impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n3.7 Provisions\nA provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.\n3.8 Leases\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in FRS 116.\n", "\n\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended 31 March 2023\n3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d) 3.8\nLeases (cont\u2019d) (i)\nAs a lessee\nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right- of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\nFor right-of-use assets that meet the definition of investment property, the Group applies the fair value model in FRS 40 Investment Property to these assets with any change therein being recognised in the statement of total return and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\nThe Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n\u2022\nfixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date.\n\n\u2022\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in the statement of total return if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets\nThe Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230622OTHRHMBI_Aims Apac Reit Management Limited_20230622071630_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [45, 48]}, {"question": "What is the maximum percentage of issued shares that the Directors of Kop Limited are authorized to purchase or otherwise acquire under the Share Purchase Mandate?", "answer": "10%", "raw_text": "What is the maximum percentage of issued shares that the Directors of Kop Limited are authorized to purchase or otherwise acquire under the Share Purchase Mandate?\n###ANSWER:\n10%", "pages": ["\nNOTICE OF\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n9.

The FC is responsible for selecting and engaging valuation experts that possess the relevant credentials and knowledge on the subject of valuation, valuation methodologies, and SFRS(I) 13 fair value measurement guidance.\nFor valuations performed by external valuation experts, the FC reviews the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and assumptions adopted. The FC also evaluates the appropriateness and reliability of the inputs (including those developed internally by the Group) used in the valuations.\nIn selecting the appropriate valuation models and inputs to be adopted for each valuation that uses significant unobservable inputs, external valuation experts are requested to calibrate the valuation models and inputs to actual market transactions (which may include transactions entered into by the Group with third parties as appropriate) that are relevant to the valuation if such information are reasonably available.\nSignificant changes in fair value measurements from period to period are evaluated by the FC for reasonableness. Key drivers of the changes are identified and assessed for reasonableness against relevant information from independent sources, or internal sources if necessary and appropriate.\n32.

Service agreements entered by Chongqing ecoWise Investment Management Co., Ltd. (cont\u2019d)\nCQEIM entered into two service agreements with Hong Kong ChenBang Investments Ltd (\u201cHKCB\u201d), a Company (the \u201cservice agreements\u201d). Based on searches of publicly available information, HKCB\u2019s sole shareholder and director is Mr Chen Chen-Chen (\u201cMr Chen\u201d). incorporated in Hong Kong, on 24 November 2020 and 24 December 2020\nUnder the service agreements, CQEIM appointed HKCB to manage and sell an office unit and a factory building for a minimum sum of RMB3,477,650 (approximately $713,000) and RMB4,620,660 (approximately $947,000) within 18 months and 12 months respectively (the \u201cCQEIM Transactions\u201d). HKCB is also the event no buyer(s) can be found within the agreed periods.\nobligated to pay CQEIM the respective minimum sums in\nManagement provided us a scanned copy of the title certificates dated 27 November 2020 and 6 January 2021 for the office unit and factory building respectively to substantiate the transfer of the ownerships of the two properties. The names of the owners on these certificates provided to us were concealed. Management clarified that they were advised by HKCB that the buyers of the properties requested privacy and not to disclose their full names to others. As the name(s) of new owner(s) on the title certificates were concealed, we are unable to determine whether the titles of the properties have been transferred and if transferred, whether the new owner(s) is an independent third party or otherwise.\nThe service agreement for the office unit also provided for CQEIM to pay a monthly rental of RMB25,000 (approximately $5,100) to HKCB for the period from 24 November 2020 to 23 May 2023 amounting to a total rental of RMB750,000 (approximately $154,000). Management informed us that CQEIM did not enter into a lease agreement with the new owner(s). In addition, HKCB is obligated under the service agreement for the factory building to ensure that the buyer of the factory building allows CQEIM to lease the factory building for one year. We were provided with a copy of the lease agreement dated 6 January 2021 and this lease agreement was entered between CQEIM and HKCB. The lease agreement for the factory building provided for CQEIM to pay a monthly rental of RMB35,000 (approximately $7,000) to HKCB for the period from 6 January 2021 until CQEIM relocated the equipment and machineries in the factory building. The total rental of the factory building from 6 January 2021 to 30 April 2021 was RMB105,000 (approximately $21,000). The leases for both the office unit and the factory building appear to be with HKCB and not the new owner(s), whose identities have not been disclosed to us as mentioned in the preceding paragraph.\nManagement advised that the minimum sums for the sale of the office unit and factory building stated in the two service agreements amounting to RMB3,477,650 (approximately $713,000) and RMB4,620,660 (approximately $947,000) were determined based on the valuation reports prepared by third-party valuers.\nWe were previously provided with valuation reports dated 7 January 2021 for the office unit and factory building in connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group for the reporting year ended 31 October 2020 (\u201cValuation Reports A\u201d). Based on Valuation Reports A, the estimated market values of the office unit and factory building as at 4 January 2021 were approximately RMB3.97 million (approximately $814,000) and RMB5.04 million (approximately $1,033,000) respectively.\nWe were also provided with another set of valuation reports for the office unit and factory building in connection with the audit of the interim financial statements of the Group for the six months ended 30 April 2021 (\u201cValuation Reports B\u201d). The dates of Valuation Reports B for the office unit and factory building are 4 January 2021 and 27 January 2021 respectively. Based on Valuation Reports B, the estimated market values of the office unit and factory building were approximately RMB3.48 million (approximately $713,000) as at 20 November 2020 and RMB4.62 million (approximately $947,000) as at 27 January 2021 respectively.\nCQEIM was stated in all four valuation reports as the owner of the two properties.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial period from 1 November 2021 to 30 April 2023\n43 Basis for disclaimer of opinion on the financial statement for the financial year end\nBasis for Disclaimer of Opinion (cont\u2019d)\nA. Service agreements entered by Chongqing ecoWise Investment Management Co., Ltd. (cont\u2019d)\nWe are not able to conclude how management had determined the minimum sums as (i) the valuation reports were dated after the date of the service agreements which specified the minimum sums; and (ii) there is no available documentation, for example, board minutes/resolution of the rationale for using the minimum sums based on the lower valuation of the properties per Valuation Reports B compared to the higher valuation per Valuation Reports A.\nCQEIM collected the proceeds from the disposal of the two properties, net of rental expense and service fees, amounting to RMB6,808,310 (approximately $1.40 million) between 31 December 2020 and 22 November 2021. On 27 November 2020, which is the date of the title certificate of the office unit substantiating the transfer of ownership mentioned above, CQEIM had yet to receive any proceeds from the disposal of the property. On 6 January 2021, which is the date of the title of the factory building substantiating the transfer of ownership mentioned above, CQEIM received approximately RMB2,000,000 (approximately $410,000) of the total net proceeds. It would appear that ownership of the two properties was transferred without CQEIM receiving the full net proceeds arising from the disposal of the properties concerned.\nBased on documents and information provided to us, the net proceeds were received from four individuals and a Company (collectively, the \u201c5 Payers\u201d). Based on searches of publicly available\ninformation, this Company was registered in the PRC on 12 November 2021 and it is an indirect subsidiary of HKCB. Management provided us authorisation letters from HKCB dated between 24 November 2020 and 16 November 2021 and supplementary agreements entered between CQEIM and HKCB dated 10 February 2022 to support management\u2019s explanation\nthat the 5 Payers had\nmade payments on behalf of HKCB. However, we are unable to determine whether the 5 Payers had indeed made payments on behalf of HKCB or the new owner(s) of the properties as the authorisation letters or supplementary agreements did not include any acknowledgement by the 5 Payers concerned.\nThe CQEIM Transactions have been accounted by the Group as disposals of property, plant and equipment based on sale prices of RMB3,477,650 (approximately $713,000) and RMB4,620,660 (approximately $947,000) for the office unit and factory building respectively. A gain on disposal of the office unit amounting to RMB220,000 (approximately $45,000) and a loss on disposal of the factory building of RMB91,000 (approximately $19,000) have been recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nWe were not provided with the following documents:\na Company directors\u2019 minutes or resolution in writing to approve CQEIM entering into the (a)\n\ntwo service agreements with HKCB and the rationale for the determination of minimum\nsums for the disposal of the properties as set out in the service agreements concerned;\n(b) the sale and purchase agreements entered between the buyer(s) and CQEIM that would have included the selling prices of the office unit and factory building, so as to ensure that the properties were sold at or lower than the minimum sums mentioned in the service agreements, and not at higher selling prices which CQEIM could have been entitled to; and\n(c) title transfer receipts issued by the local land bureau relating to the CQEIM Transactions, which are documents that provide support for the accounting and disclosures of the CQEIM Transactions as disposal of property, plant and equipment.\nManagement explained that HKCB handled and kept all the documents relating to the CQEIM Transactions and while management has requested HKCB to provide these documents, the documents have not been provided by HKCB.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial period from 1 November 2021 to 30 April 2023\n43 Basis for disclaimer of opinion on the financial statement for the financial year end\nBasis for Disclaimer of Opinion (cont\u2019d)\nA. Service agreements entered by Chongqing ecoWise Investment Management Co., Ltd. (cont\u2019d)\nIn addition, in an audit committee meeting held on 20 December 2021, an executive director of the Company asserted that he was not aware that the Group had acquired the office unit in Chongqing, PRC (that has now been disposed as one of the CQEIM Transactions) and he was the beneficial owner of an office unit in Chongqing which he had allowed CQEIM to occupy at no rental charge. The director furnished to us a photocopy of a property title certification dated in 2011. The address of the property on this title certificate was the same as the address stated on the service agreement for office unit in the CQEIM Transactions. On 25 March 2022, the executive director concerned updated us that a law firm in the PRC engaged by him had undertaken a search at the land bureau office in Chongqing and reported that the said office unit had been sold to CQEIM in 2017 by an individual on behalf of the executive director in accordance with a notarised letter of authorisation signed by the executive director concerned. The executive director advised us that he was neither aware of the sale nor receive any sale proceeds.\nAlthough management provided responses and explanations relating to our inquiries about the CQEIM Transactions, we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on the commercial substance of the transactions. We were also not provided with sufficient and appropriate evidence to determine that the CQEIM Transactions have been properly and accurately accounted for as a disposal of property, plant and equipment as well as with regards to the rental of the office unit and factory building and the relevant and appropriate disclosures applicable to the CQEIM Transactions have been made in the financial statements. Please also refer to Item B below relating to disclosures of related party transactions.\nB. Disclosures of related party relationships, transactions and balances\nAs mentioned in A above, CQEIM entered into the CQEIM Transactions with HKCB during the reporting year.\nHKCB owns 100% of the issued and paid up capital of Chen Bang Energy Pte Ltd (\u201cCBE\u201d), a\nCompany incorporated in Singapore. CBE was previously known as ecoWise Energy Pte Ltd and was previously a subsidiary of the Group. HKCB acquired CBE from the Group in July 2019. We noted that an executive director and a senior management member of the Company were the director and Company secretary of CBE respectively at the dates of the CQEIM Transactions. On 26 January 2021, the senior management member was also appointed as a director of CBE. On 16 February 2022, the senior management member resigned as a director and Company secretary of CBE. On 14 March 2022, the executive director resigned as a director of CBE.\nBased on searches of publicly available information, we noted that the executive director mentioned in relation to CBE above and two other senior management members of the Group were legal representative and directors of two entities registered in the PRC that appear to be related to HKCB at the dates of the CQEIM Transactions. The executive director concerned resigned as the legal representative of these two entities on 18 October 2021 and 7 January 2022. A senior management member resigned as a director of one of these entities on 7 January 2022.\nAlthough management provided responses and explanations relating to our inquiries in relation to the CQEIM Transactions and the relationships between the executive director and certain senior management of the Group and HKCB, we are unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to establish whether HKCB is a related party of the Group or otherwise.

The assumed movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently observable market environment.

Underlying this commitment is the belief that good corporate governance will help to enhance corporate performance and protect the interests of Shareholders.\nThis report describes the corporate governance processes and practices of the Group that were in place throughout the financial year ended 31 March 2023 (\u201cFY2023\u201d), with specific reference made to the principles and provisions of the Code, which forms part of the continuing obligations under the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the\n\u201cSGX-ST\u201d) (\u201cCatalist Rules\u201d).\nOur corporate governance principles reflect the Board\u2019s focus on strong leadership, effective internal controls and risk management, a robust corporate culture, accountability to Shareholders and engagement with stakeholders. The Board is pleased to confirm that for FY2023, the Group has adhered to the core principles of corporate governance, and in all material respects, with the provisions of the Code and the Catalist Rules, where appropriate, except for the following Provisions where the deviations and explanations have been provided:-\n\nProvision 3.1 \u2013 Common Role of Chairman and CEO\nProvision 9.1 \u2013 Establishment of a Separate Risk Committee\nBOARD MATTERS\nTHE BOARD\u2019S CONDUCT OF ITS AFFAIRS\nPrinciple 1: Effective Board to Lead and Control the Company\nProvision 1.1 Roles and Duties of Board\nThe Board is entrusted with the responsibility for the overall management of the business and corporate affairs of the Group. It provides entrepreneurial leadership and sets goals, reviews and advises on overall strategies and directions, oversees the effectiveness of the Management and assumes responsibilities for overall corporate governance of the Group to ensure the Group\u2019s strategies are in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders.\nTo this end, each director of the Company (\u201cDirector\u201d) endeavours to objectively discharge his or her duties and responsibilities as fiduciaries in the interests of the Company. Apart from its statutory duties and responsibilities, the Board also:\n(a) decides on matters in relation to the Group\u2019s activities which are of significant nature, including decisions on strategic directions and guidelines and approvals of annual budget, major funding investment and divestment proposals;\n(b) oversees risk management and internal control processes, financial reporting and compliance, including the release of financial results and announcements of material transactions;\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\n(c) reviews management performance;\n(d) identifies key stakeholder groups and recognises that their perceptions affect the Company\u2019s reputation;\n(e) sets the Company\u2019s value and standards, and ensures that the obligations to Shareholders and other stakeholders are understood and met;\n(f) approves the nominations to the Board and appointments to the various Board committees;\n(g) approves the framework of remuneration for the Board and key executives as recommended by the Remuneration Committee;\n(h) provides oversight in the proper conduct of the Group\u2019s business and assumes responsibility for corporate governance; and\n(i) considers sustainability issues as part of the strategic formulation.\nThe Board exercises due diligence and independent judgement in dealing with the business affairs of the Group. It works with the Management, its external advisors and auditors to make objective decisions in the interest of the Group. In addition, the Board sets the tone for the entire organisation where ethics and values are concerned. The Board is also supported by three Board committees to facilitate the discharge of its functions to which it has delegated specific areas of responsibilities.\nEach Director acts in good faith and in the best interest of the Company and contributes their own expertise, skills, knowledge and experiences to the Board for the benefit of the Shareholders.\nConflict of Interest\nAll Directors of the Company are expected to be cognisant of their statutory duties, and to discharge them objectively in the interest of the Company. Internal guidelines have been established which require all Board members who have a potential conflict of interest in a particular agenda item to recuse themselves from participating in the meetings, discussions, and decisions on the matter at all levels within the Group including, but not limited to, the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and any committees and sub-committees, if any, that are involved in the proposed transaction in which the Director has an interest or in respect of which the Director is conflicted. Such compliance will be recorded in the minutes of meeting and/or directors\u2019 resolutions in writing from time to time, when applicable.\nProvision 1.2 Continuous Training and Development of Directors\nThe Board also ensures that incoming new Directors are given guidance and orientation to familiarise them with the Group\u2019s business and corporate governance practices upon their appointment to facilitate the effective discharge of their duties. Any newly appointed Director who has no prior experience as a director of a Singapore-listed company is required to attend the relevant prescribed training on the roles and responsibilities as a director of a listed company in Singapore, conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors (\u201cSID\u201d) or other training institutions in areas such as accounting, legal and industry-specific knowledge where appropriate, in connection with their duties unless the Nominating Committee is of the view that training is not required because he/she has other relevant experience, in which case the basis of its assessment will be disclosed.\nTo get a better understanding of the Group\u2019s business, the Directors are also given the opportunity to visit the Group\u2019s operations and meet with members of the Management. This allows incoming Directors to get better acquainted with the nature and working of the Group\u2019s business as well as to familiarise themselves with members of the Management.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHR4OFY_Japan Foods Holding Ltd._20230705065716_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [54, 57]}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Vividthree Holdings Ltd.?", "answer": "The purpose of the AGM is to transact the following business:\n1.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (cont\u2019d)\n(a) Market risk (cont\u2019d)\n(ii) Price risk\nThe Group and the Company is exposed to equity security price risk arising from its investment securities. Please refer to Note 16 for details of the fair value measurement.\n(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risks\nCash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Group\u2019s exposure to cash flow interest rate risks arises mainly from a loan to an associate (2022: bank borrowings and loan to an associate) at variable rates.\nIf the interest rates had been higher/lower by 2% (2022: 1%) with all other variables including tax rate being held constant, the Group\u2019s profit after tax for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 would have been higher/lower by $200,000 (2022: $17,000) as a result of higher/lower interest income from loan to an associate (2022: higher/lower interest income from loan to an associate and higher/lower interest expense on borrowings).\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Company\u2019s exposure to cash flow interest rate risks arises mainly from loans to/from subsidiaries (2022: loans to/from subsidiaries) at variable rates.\nIf the interest rates had been higher/lower by 2% (2022: 1%) with all other variables including tax rate being held constant, the Company\u2019s profit after tax for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 would have been higher/lower by $3,391,000 (2022: $1,175,000), as a result of higher/lower interest income on loans to subsidiaries and higher/lower interest expense on loans from subsidiaries.\n(b) Credit risk\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.\nThe Group adopts the policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit standing and history, and obtaining appropriate and sufficient collateral such as security deposits or bankers guarantee from customers, where appropriate, to mitigate credit risk. For other financial assets, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with high credit quality counterparties.\nBefore accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customer\u2019s credit quality and their financial ability to pay for the services engaged. Management periodically monitors and reviews the customer\u2019s long overdue payment and proactively engages with the customer to resolve the causes of the overdue payment. As at 31 March 2023, there are three (2022: five) external customers which individually represents more than 5% of the Group\u2019s total trade receivables. There is no (2022: no) external customer which individually represents more than 5% of the Company\u2019s total trade receivables.\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk for each class of financial assets is the carrying amount of that class of financial instruments presented on the statement of financial position.\nIn determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially assessed up to the balance sheet date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, management believes that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for impairment of receivables.\n", "160 Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n31. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (cont\u2019d)\n(b) Credit risk (cont\u2019d)\nTrade receivables and contract assets\nIn measuring expected credit losses (\u201cECL\u201d), trade receivables and contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics. The contract assets relate mainly to projects where the revenue has been accrued ahead of billings to customers, which have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same contracts.\nThe Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.\nIn calculating the expected credit loss rates, the Group considers historical loss rates for each category of customers and adjusts to reflect current and forward-looking macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.\nSome of the forward-looking macroeconomic factors include:\n\n\u2022\nHistorical default rate of the customer\n\n\u2022   Any publicly available information on the customer\n\u2022   Any macroeconomic or geopolitical information relevant to the customer\n\u2022   Any other objectively supportable information on the quality and abilities of the customer\u2019s management   relevant for its performance\nTrade receivables (including retention receivables) and contract assets grouped with shared risk characteristics as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 are as follows:\nGroup 2023\nCurrent and Past due Past due under over\nnot due 3 months 3 months Total\n$\u2019000 $\u2019000 $\u2019000 $\u2019000\n-\n\nSingapore * \n\u2022\n112,462 573 1,099 114,134\n\nTrade receivables\nContract assets\n15,954 - - 15,954\n\n\u2022\n\t\t\t\t\t -\n\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam * \n\u2022\n726 - 137 863\n\nTrade receivables\nContract assets\n165 - - 165\n\n\u2022\n\t\t\t\t\t -\n\nMalaysia * \n\u2022\n9,202 183 2 4,428 13,632 183\n\nTrade receivables\nContract assets\n- -\n\n\u2022\n\t\t\t\t\t -\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\u2022\n283 - - 283 Trade receivables\n138,975 575 5,664 145,214 \t\t\t\t\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n31.

Our employees were introduced to various sustainable farming methods. The event was held on 29 July 2022 and guided by City Sprouts Pte Ltd at Henderson Road, where they have transformed part of the former Henderson Secondary School into an urban farming redevelopment. From the event, the employees have also learnt that locally grown food produces a much smaller carbon footprint as there is less factory farming and less travel, creating access to fresher produce with little or no preservatives.\nPromoting Customer Health and Safety [MA 416, 416-2]\nThe building and construction industry is responsible for promoting the health and safety of customers who use the structures they build. As such, companies in this industry must adopt measures to ensure the safety of their customers, especially post-construction. We ensure that all structures we build comply with relevant health and safety regulations, including building, fire, and electrical safety codes, among others.\nMoreover, we prioritise the use of sustainable materials and construction practices that not only meet safety standards but also minimise environmental impacts. A safe and healthy environment for our customers contributes to the overall appreciation of our projects in terms of quality and serviceability. By adopting IDD, we aim to reduce environmental impacts such as dust and other construction hazards that could affect the health and well-being of the communities within the perimeter of our projects.\nIn FY2023, the Company has identified one non- compliance with the regulation or voluntary codes regarding the health and safety of its products/services by the contractor - one of our construction sites was issued a \u2018Stop Work Order\u2019 by the National Environment Agency (\u201cNEA\u201d) as it was found to have areas susceptible to breeding mosquitoes.

Fair values have been determined for measurement and/ or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.\n(i) Derivatives\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps and currency forward contracts (Level 2 fair values) are based on banks\u2019 quotes. These quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date.\n(ii) Other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities\nOther non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at initial recognition and for disclosure purposes, at each annual reporting date. Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the measurement date.\nThe carrying amounts of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year (including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables) are assumed to approximate their fair values because of the short period to maturity. The carrying amounts of non-derivative financial liabilities with maturity of more than one year (including trade and other payables) are assumed to approximate their fair values because the effect of discounting is immaterial. The carrying amount of borrowings which reprice within three months are assumed to approximate their fair values because of the short period to maturity or repricing. The fair values of the fixed rate notes are based on banks\u2019 quotes. The fair value disclosure of lease liabilities is not required.\nThe Group\u2019s policy is to recognise transfers between levels as of the end of the reporting period during which the transfer has occurred. There had been no transfers between the levels during the year.\n27 SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Manager considers the business from a geographical segment perspective. Geographically, the Manager manages and monitors the business by two countries: Singapore and Australia. For each of the reporting segments, the Manager reviews internal management reports on a monthly basis.

In Malaysia, our largest project in the country was delivered for Lam Research\u2019s integrated manufacturing and office facility in Penang. In Singapore, we completed JTC semiconSpace@Tampines, a \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 multi-tenanted development with extremely high- specification requirements for smaller semiconductor players to accelerate the set up of operations. Both of our completed projects for JTC Corporation were awarded JTC Construction Safety Award Special Mentions, an endorsement of our QEHS efforts.\nIn FY2023, we regained momentum in business development efforts with the securing of a record contract valued at approximately S$300 million from a repeat Fortune 500 technology client, involving the design-and-build of an integrated manufacturing, logistics and office facility. Targeted for completion in 2024, the facility is earmarked to achieve Green Mark Platinum under the Building & Construction Authority\u2019s revised Green Mark Certification Scheme: 2021. In line with our strategy of diversifying geographically, we also secured two contracts in the overseas market of Malaysia, one of which is a design-and- build contract for an aerospace facility at Subang Aerotech Park and a separate design-and-build contract from a global power control solutions corporation \u2013 our third collaboration with them.\n#MOVED-TO-PREVIOUS-FLOW\nTechnology continued to play a key role in mitigating risks associated with the pandemic by increasing productivity while reducing reliance on labour, allowing for highly collaborative activities such as IDD, value engineering and physical construction activities to be conducted in a productive and safe manner. Among the more recent initiatives are the Common Data Environment (\u201cCDE\u201d) and Digital Operations & Maintenance Manuals (\u201cDOMM\u201d). CDE is a centralised digital hub where project information is shared and stored, to enhance digital collaboration. DOMM improves data governance and enhances the review process of the many project stakeholders, from construction to facilities management by embracing the digitalisation of building lifecycle activities. We aim to foster a data- driven culture within the organisation, particularly in improving the quality and speed of decision making through data and data visualisation.

Based on the historical credit loss experience, the Group considers a financial asset as in default if the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 180 days when they fall due which is derived based on the Group\u2019s historical information, and write-off the financial asset when there is no reasonable ground to recover the receivables after all enforcement activity has been taken by the Group.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n32 Financial Instruments (cont\u2019d)\n(a) Financial risk management (cont\u2019d)\niv.

The NC formally discusses and agrees on the appointment or reappointment of Directors in a formal and open process and makes its recommendation to the Board accordingly. In recommending the reappointment of Directors, the NC and the Board will consider the Director\u2019s past performance and whether he has fully discharged his duties and obligations. The NC and the Board will also consider whether the Director to be reappointed has been involved in companies with an adverse track record or a history of irregularities, including the reasons for the Director\u2019s resignation from a previous company, and whether the Director himself has been under any investigations, including by the professional association or regulatory body he is a member of.\nWhen the need for a new director arises, the NC will review the expertise, skills and attributes of the current Board as a whole, discuss the requirements required of the new director, shortlist and interview candidates with the appropriate profi les for nomination to the Board. New directors are usually identified from contacts of the Directors and/or through executive search firms, if a particular director with specialised skillsets is required. In its search and selection process, the NC and the Board will, respectively, interview at least 2 shortlisted candidates.\nNew directors must submit themselves for re-election at the annual general meeting of the Company following their initial appointment. Regulation 89 of the Company\u2019s Constitution requires at least one- third of the Board to retire via rotation at every annual general meeting. Retiring directors are eligible for re-appointments at annual general meetings. Directors who have been appointed casually to fill a vacancy must retire at the next annual general meeting and are eligible for reelection.\nProvision 4.1 - Establishment of Nominating Committee\nThe Board has established an NC which comprises all three Independent Directors.

In addition, the NC has the liberty to instruct executive search companies, receive referrals from personal contacts (as relevant), deliberate on and consider recommendations in its search and nomination process for the right candidates.\nNew directors are appointed by the Board after the NC has reviewed and recommended their appointments. When the need for a new director arises, the NC will review the expertise, skills and attributes of the Board as a whole, identify its needs and shortlist candidates with the appropriate profiles for nomination. In its search and selection process, the NC will interview at least 2 shortlisted candidates. The criteria used in identifying new directors are based primarily on the skills and experience required at the time and while gender in and of itself is not considered a criterion, female candidates are identified for consideration in pursuit of its Diversity Policy.\nProvision 4.4 - NC\u2019s determination of directors\u2019 independence\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Code, the NC reviewed the independence status of the Independent Directors and is of the view that they are all in compliance with the Code\u2019s definition of independence and no Independent Director falls under any of the circumstances described in Rule 210(5) (d) of the Listing Manual.\nThe NC reviews at the end of each financial year and from time to time, where circumstances so require, the independence of a Director in accordance with such director\u2019s disclosure and written confirmation of independence. Where any Director has any relationship with the Company or where there are other factors that may impede a Director\u2019s independence, such relationship or factors will be documented and disclosed accordingly in the Company\u2019s annual peport.\nProvision 4.5 - NC\u2019s determination of directors\u2019 duties, performance and e\ufb00ectiveness\nAt the end of each financial year, the NC makes a formal assessment of the performance of the Board as a whole and also each Director\u2019s performance and determines if each Director has carried out his or her duty adequately.\nThe section \u201cNC Report for FY2023\u201d sets out the principal commitments of each Director and the number of other directorships each Director holds in both private and publicly listed companies. In this connection, the Company does not set a maximum number of listed company board representations its Directors may have, but takes into account the actual number of directorships and principal commitments each Director has in assessing its ability to discharge his or her duties.\n", "\n\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE\nPrinciple 5: Board Performance\nThe Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its e\ufb00ectiveness as a whole and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.\nProvision 5.1 - NC recommends for Board approval performance of Board, each Board committee, the Chairman and each individual director\nAs stated above in accordance with Provision 4.5, the NC makes a formal assessment of the performance of the Board as a whole and also of each Director, and determines if each Director has carried out their duty adequately. Prior to making such assessment, the NC will recommend for the Board\u2019s approval the performance criteria it will adopt in making the assessment.\nFor the financial year ended 30 April 2023, all members of the NC were requested to complete a Board Assessment Checklist designed to seek their view on the various aspects of the Board\u2019s performance to assess the overall e\ufb00ectiveness of the Board. The performance criteria for Board evaluation covers amongst other criteria, composition structure and processes of the Board, access to information, corporate strategy, internal control and risk management and standard of conduct.\nThe completed checklists were submitted to the Company Secretary for record purposes and the consolidated responses were presented to by the NC to the Board for discussion and determination of any area(s) for improvement. While the checklists have been used to serve as a guide, the ultimate assessment of the Board and each Director is based on the discussions and conclusions of the NC upon reviewing these checklists.\nThe factors taken into consideration for the re-appointment of Directors for the year under review are, amongst other matters, the Director\u2019s attendance at meetings held during the year including their preparation and participation made at such meetings.\nThe NC\u2019s Report for FY2023\nFor FY2023, the NC is pleased to provide the following summary relating to its work as follows:\nA.

CHAPTER 9 OF THE LISTING MANUAL\n1.1 Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual (\u201cChapter 9\u201d) governs transactions by a listed company, as well as transactions by its subsidiaries and associated companies that are considered to be at risk, with the listed company\u2019s interested persons. When this Chapter applies to a transaction and the value of that transaction alone or on aggregation with other transactions conducted with the interested person during the same financial year reaches, or exceeds, certain materiality thresholds, the listed company is required to make an immediate announcement, or to make an immediate announcement and seek its shareholders\u2019 approval for that transaction.\n1.2 Except for certain transactions which, by reason of the nature of such transactions, are not considered to put the listed company at risk to its interested persons and hence are excluded from the ambit of Chapter 9, immediate announcement and shareholders\u2019 approval would be required in respect of transactions with interested persons if certain financial thresholds (which are based on the value of the transaction as compared with the listed company\u2019s latest audited consolidated net tangible assets (\u201cNTA\u201d)) are reached or exceeded. In particular, shareholders\u2019 approval is required for an interested person transaction of a value equal to, or exceeding:\n(a) 5% of the listed company\u2019s latest audited consolidated NTA; or\n(b) 5% of the listed company\u2019s latest audited consolidated NTA, when aggregated with other transactions entered into with the same interested person (as such term is construed under Chapter 9) during the same financial year.\n1.3 Based on the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 March 2023, the consolidated NTA of the Group was S$1,625.3 million. In relation to SIAEC, and for the purposes of complying with Chapter 9, in the current financial year and until such time as the consolidated audited financial statements of the Group for the financial year ending 31 March 2024 are published, 5% of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group would be S$81.3 million.\n1.4 Chapter 9 permits a listed company, however, to seek a general mandate from its shareholders for recurrent transactions of a revenue or trading nature or those necessary for its day-to-day operations such as the purchase and sale of supplies and materials (but not in respect of the purchase or sale of assets, undertakings or businesses) that may be carried out with the listed company\u2019s interested persons.\n1.5 Under the Listing Manual:\n(a)\n\nan \u201capproved exchange\u201d means a stock exchange that has rules which safeguard the interests of shareholders\nagainst interested person transactions according to similar principles to Chapter 9;\n(b) (in the case of a company) an \u201cassociate\u201d in relation to an interested person who is a director, chief executive officer or controlling shareholder includes an immediate family member (that is, the spouse, child, adopted- child, step-child, sibling or parent) of such director, chief executive officer or controlling shareholder, the trustees of any trust of which the director/his immediate family, the chief executive officer/his immediate family or controlling shareholder/his immediate family is a beneficiary or, in the case of a discretionary trust, is a discretionary object, and any company in which the director/his immediate family, the chief executive officer/his immediate family or controlling shareholder/his immediate family has an aggregate interest (directly or indirectly) of 30% or more, and, where a controlling shareholder is a corporation, its subsidiary or holding company or fellow subsidiary or a company in which it and/or they have (directly or indirectly) an interest of 30% or more;\n(c)\n\nan \u201cassociated company\u201d means a company in which at least 20% but not more than 50% of its shares are\nheld by the listed company or group;\n(d) \u201ccontrol\u201d means the capacity to dominate decision-making, directly or indirectly, in relation to the financial and operating policies of a company;\n(e)\n\na \u201ccontrolling shareholder\u201d means a person who (i) holds directly or indirectly 15% or more of the total\nnumber of issued shares in the company excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings (the SGX-ST may\ndetermine that such person is not a controlling shareholder); or (ii) in fact exercises control over a company;\n", "\n\n\nTHE APPENDIX\nTHE IPT MANDATE\n(f) an \u201centity at risk\u201d means:\n(i) the listed company;\n(ii) a subsidiary of the listed company that is not listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange; or\n(iii) an associated company of the listed company that is not listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange, provided that the listed company and/or its subsidiaries (the \u201clisted group\u201d), or the listed group and its interested person(s), has control over the associated company;\n(g) (in the case of a company) an \u201cinterested person\u201d means a director, chief executive officer or controlling shareholder of the listed company or an associate of such director, chief executive officer or controlling shareholder. The SGX-ST may also deem any person or entity to be an interested person if the person or entity has entered into, or proposes to enter into (i) a transaction with an entity at risk, and (ii) an agreement or arrangement with an interested person in connection with that transaction; and\n(h) an \u201cinterested person transaction\u201d means a transaction between an entity at risk and an interested person.\n2. THE IPT MANDATE\n2.1 Rationale for the IPT Mandate\n2.1.1 It is anticipated that the EAR Group (as defined in paragraph 2.1.2 below) would, in the ordinary course of its business, enter into certain transactions with its Interested Persons (as defined below). It is likely that such transactions will occur with some degree of frequency and could arise at any time. Such transactions include, but are not limited to, the transactions described in paragraph 2.4 below. Among other things, the entry into of financial and treasury support transactions described in paragraph 2.4(g) below will benefit the EAR Group, as the EAR Group will have access to competitive quotes from its Interested Persons in addition to obtaining quotes from, or transacting with, non-Interested Persons. Similarly, the Company notes that the energy industry in Singapore had been deregulated and may now obtain electricity and other power sources and utilities from Interested Persons that carry on such business. Given the competition arising from the deregulation, it may be beneficial to the EAR Group to enter into such transactions with the relevant Interested Persons to take advantage of such competition in terms of pricing, products and services.\n2.1.2 Owing to the time-sensitive nature of commercial transactions, the Directors are seeking approval from the Shareholders for this proposed IPT Mandate pursuant to Chapter 9 to enable:\n(a) SIAEC;\n(b) subsidiaries of SIAEC (excluding subsidiaries listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange); and\n(c) associated companies of SIAEC (excluding associated companies listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange) over which the Group, or the Group and interested person(s) of SIAEC has or have control,\n(together, the \u201cEAR Group\u201d), or any of them, in the normal course of their business, to enter into the categories of interested person transactions (\u201cInterested Person Transactions\u201d) described in paragraph 2.4 below with the specified classes of SIAEC\u2019s interested persons (the \u201cInterested Persons\u201d) set out in paragraph 2.3.1 below, provided that such transactions are made on the EAR Group\u2019s normal commercial terms.\n2.1.3 The IPT Mandate will take effect from the date of the passing of Ordinary Resolution No. 7.3 to be proposed at the 2023 AGM, and will (unless revoked or varied in general meeting) continue in force until the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company. Thereafter, approval from Shareholders for a renewal of the IPT Mandate will be sought at each subsequent AGM of the Company, subject to the satisfactory review by the Audit Committee of its continued application to the transactions with Interested Persons.\n", "\n |  | THE APPENDIX   THE IPT MANDATE\n2.2 | Scope of the IPT Mandate | \n2.2.1 SIA and its subsidiaries provide a whole range of services to the EAR Group including financial support, technical and information technology services, insurance services, central purchasing, internal audit and other support services, whilst the EAR Group provides, inter alia, maintenance, repair and overhaul services to SIA and Scoot Pte. Ltd. (formerly known as Scoot Tigerair Pte Ltd).\n2.2.2 The IPT Mandate will not cover any transaction by a company in the EAR Group with an Interested Person that is below S$100,000 in value as the threshold and aggregation requirements of Chapter 9 would not apply to such transactions. The IPT Mandate would, however, cover Interested Person Transactions with values below S$100,000 entered into during the same financial year and which are aggregated by the SGX-ST under Chapter 9 and treated as if they were one Interested Person Transaction which has a value of S$100,000 or more.\n2.3 Classes of Interested Persons\n2.3.1 The IPT Mandate will apply to the Interested Person Transactions (as described in paragraph 2.4 below) which are carried out with Temasek and its associates (which include SIA and its associates).\n2.3.2 Transactions with Interested Persons which do not fall within the ambit of the IPT Mandate shall be subject to the relevant provisions of the Listing Manual. The IPT Mandate does not apply to Interested Person Transactions with the CEO of the Company, the Directors, and their respective associates, for which separate Shareholders\u2019 approval will be obtained if it becomes necessary to do so.\n2.4 Interested Person Transactions\nThe Interested Person Transactions which will be covered by the IPT Mandate and the benefits to be derived from them are the general transactions by the EAR Group relating to the provision to, or the obtaining from or through, Interested Persons, or the joint transacting with Interested Persons for, products and services in the normal course of business of the EAR Group (but not in respect of the purchase or sale of assets, undertakings or businesses), including:\n(a) repair, modification, maintenance, servicing, overhaul and other engineering and technical services relating to aircraft, aircraft engines, equipment, aircraft and/or engine spares, parts and components;\n(b)\n\nsale and purchase of aircraft, aircraft engines, aircraft and/or engine spares, parts and components, electronic\nand electrical engineering equipment;\n(c) charter and/or lease of aircraft, aircraft engines, equipment, aircraft and/or engine spares, parts and components;\n(d) security services;\n(e) obtaining and/or lease of computer equipment, provision of computer maintenance services and systems, development, licensing and acquisition of computer software programmes and other information technology- related equipment, goods and services;\n(f) rental and licensing of space, both as lessor/lessee and licensor/licensee and the provision of building maintenance services, lease and development of property for investment purposes;\n(g) provision of central purchasing, financial and treasury support (including borrowing of funds from, and placement of funds with, Interested Persons, entry into forex, swap and option transactions with or through Interested Persons for hedging purposes, subscription of debt securities issued by Interested Persons, and provision of fund management services), tax, internal audit, staff training and centrally organised activities and meetings for staff and Management, staff transportation and other personnel-related or staff welfare- related services, provision of management and corporate support, staff pooling, technical support, central reservations and other telecommunications systems and support, and other related services;\n(h) provision of freight and related services;\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230621OTHRQ25U_Sia Engineering Company Limited_20230621043025_00_AR_4Q_20230331.2.pdf", "page_number": [6, 9]}, {"question": "What is the gross carrying amount of trade receivables of the Group as of 31 March 2023?", "answer": "The gross carrying amount of trade receivables of the Group as of 31 March 2023 is $863,000.", "raw_text": "What is the gross carrying amount of trade receivables of the Group as of 31 March 2023?\n###ANSWER:\nThe gross carrying amount of trade receivables of the Group as of 31 March 2023 is $863,000.", "pages": ["\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n36.

Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in the contract with a customer to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer.\nDesign, fabrication and sale of precision plastic injection mould (\u201cMDF\u201d)\nThe Group manufactures and supplies moulds for manufacturers. As the Group is restricted contractually from directing the moulds for another use as they are being produced and the Group has enforceable right to payment for performance completed to-date, revenue is recognised over time, based on the stages of mould manufacturing process completed to-date.\nProgress billings to the customers are based on a payment schedule in the contract and are typically triggered upon the achievement of specified manufacturing milestones. A contract asset is recognised when the Group has performed under the contract but has not yet billed the customer. Conversely, a contract liability is recognised when the Group has not yet performed under the contract but has received advanced payments from the customer. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights to consideration become unconditional. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue as the Group performs under the contract.\nCosts to fulfil a contract are capitalised if the costs relate directly to the contract, generate or enhance resources used in satisfying the contract and are expected to be recovered. Other contract costs are expensed as incurred.\nDesign, fabrication and sale of precision plastic injection mould (\u201cMDF\u201d) (cont\u2019d)\nCapitalised contract costs are subsequently recognised in profit or loss as the Group recognises the related revenue. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the capitalised contract costs exceeds the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services to which the contract costs relate less the costs that relate directly to providing the goods and that have not been recognised as an expense.\n(f) Government Grants\nGrants from the government are recognised as a receivable at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received. Government grants receivable are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government grants relating to expenses are shown separately under other income in profit or loss.\nGovernment grants relating to assets are deducted against the carrying amount of the assets.\n(g) Employee Benefits\nEmployee benefits are recognised as an expense, unless the cost qualifies to be capitalised as an asset.\nDefined contribution plan\nDefined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into separate entities such as the Central Provident Fund on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\nPayments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n2 Significant Accounting Policies (cont\u2019d)\n(g) Employee Benefits (cont\u2019d)\nDefined benefit retirement plan\nThe cost of providing benefits under defined benefit retirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:\n(i) Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on settlements);\n(ii) Net interest expense or income; and\n(iii) Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability/(asset) in other comprehensive income.\nThe Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in profit or loss in employee benefits expense. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of plan amendment. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\nRemeasurement, comprising actual gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which remeasurement occurs. Remeasurement gains and losses are not reclassified to profit or loss subsequently.\nThe retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Group\u2019s defined benefit plans. Any such surplus is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of estimated plan refunds and reductions in future plan contributions.\nA liability for a termination benefit is recognised when the Group can no longer withdraw offer of these termination benefit, or when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs, whichever is earlier.\n(h) Borrowing Costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period using the effective interest method in which they are incurred.\n(i) Income Tax\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nCurrent income tax for current and prior periods is recognised at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n2 Significant Accounting Policies (cont\u2019d)\n(i) Income Tax (cont\u2019d)\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be recognised.\nSuch deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset recognised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nThe measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its tax assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nThe Group recognises a previously recognised deferred tax asset to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\nFor the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets for investment properties that are measured using fair value model, the carrying amounts of such properties are presumed to be recovered entirely through sale, unless the presumption is rebutted. The presumption is rebutted when the investment property is depreciable and is held within a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefit embodied in the investment property over time, rather than through sale\nCurrent and deferred tax for the year\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in the accounting for the business combination.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230926OTHRI4T0_Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd._20230926175412_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [54, 57]}, {"question": "What was the primary reason for the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Softbank Group Corp.?", "answer": "The primary reason for the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Softbank Group Corp. was a decrease in cash inflows from the sale of investments at SB Northstar, from \u00a52,044,495 million to \u00a5126,062 million, accompanying the downsizing of its business.", "raw_text": "What was the primary reason for the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Softbank Group Corp.?\n###ANSWER:\nThe primary reason for the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Softbank Group Corp. was a decrease in cash inflows from the sale of investments at SB Northstar, from \u00a52,044,495 million to \u00a5126,062 million, accompanying the downsizing of its business.", "pages": ["Cash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities resulted in a net inflow of \u00a5741,292 million, a \u00a51,984,158 million decrease year on year.

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\nThe Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.\nGoodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses, represents the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previously-held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the fair value of the investee\u2019s identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Gains and losses on the disposal of subsidiaries, include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.\nThe Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the de\ufb01nition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether an integrated set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. A business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to create output. The Group has an option to apply a \u2018fair value concentration test\u2019 that permits a simpli\ufb01ed assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The concentration test can be applied on a transaction- by-transaction basis. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identi\ufb01able asset or group of similar identi\ufb01able assets. If the test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business and no further assessment is needed. If the test is not met, or if the Group elects not to apply the test, a detailed assessment must be performed applying the normal requirements in SFRS(I) 3.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n2 Significant Accounting Policies (cont\u2019d)\n(b) Group accounting (cont\u2019d)\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest\u2019s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer\u2019s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\nIf the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously-held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired as in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.\nInter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment indicator of the transferred assets. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group\u2019s accounting policies.\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions \u2013 that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals of interests in subsidiaries to non-controlling interests without loss of control are also recorded in equity.\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it:\n\u2022\n\nderecognises the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at\nthe date when control is lost;\n\u2022\n\nderecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest (including any components of other\ncomprehensive income attributable to them);\n\u2022 recognises the fair value of the consideration received;\n\u2022 recognises the fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value;\n\u2022 re-classifies the Group\u2019s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate; and\n\u2022 recognises any resulting difference in profit or loss.\n(c) Investment in Subsidiaries\nInvestment in subsidiaries is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses in the statement of financial position of the Company.\nOn disposal of investment in subsidiaries, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the investment is recognised in the profit or loss.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n2 Significant Accounting Policies (cont\u2019d)\n(d) Disposal Group Classified as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nDisposal groups are classified as held for sale or distribution if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction or distribution rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.\nWhen the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria set out above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale. Disposal groups classified as held for sale (held for distribution) are measured at the lower of the assets\u2019 previous carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell (fair value less costs to distribute).\nThe assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held-for-sale. In addition, equity accounting of associates and joint ventures ceases once classified as held for sale. Any impairment loss on initial classification and subsequent measurement is recognised as an expense. Any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell (not exceeding the accumulated impairment loss that has been previously recognised) is recognised in profit or loss.\nA discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or that is classified as held-for- sale and;\ni. represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\nii. is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\niii. is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\nWhen a component of an entity qualifies as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is retrospectively restated to segregate the results of all operations that have been discontinued by the end of the latest reporting period.\n(e) Revenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\nRevenue is recognised when the Group satisfied a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.\nElectronic components distribution business units (\u201cEBU\u201d) (Discontinued operation)\nSales of goods \u2013 distribution of electronic components\nRevenue is recognised at a point in time when the Group satisfies its performance obligation by transferring the control of promised goods to the customer, which is when the goods are delivered to the destination specified by the customer, typically referring to the incoterms specified in the contract. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in the contract with a customer to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230926OTHRI4T0_Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd._20230926175412_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [51, 54]}, {"question": "Has Huong Wei Beng ever been the subject of any current or past investigation or disciplinary proceedings, or has been reprimanded or issued any warning, by the Monetary Authority of Singapore or any other regulatory authority, exchange, professional body or government agency, whether in Singapore or elsewhere?", "answer": "No", "raw_text": "Has Huong Wei Beng ever been the subject of any current or past investigation or disciplinary proceedings, or has been reprimanded or issued any warning, by the Monetary Authority of Singapore or any other regulatory authority, exchange, professional body or government agency, whether in Singapore or elsewhere?\n###ANSWER: No", "pages": ["NOtice of Annual General meeting\n\nSINGAPORE SHIPPING CORPORATION LIMITED\nCompany Registration No. 198801332G\n(Incorporated in the Republic of Singapore)\nName of Person\n\nOw Cheo Guan\nPebble Sia Huei-Chieh\nHuong Wei Beng\nA Selverajah\n(g)\n\nWhether he has ever been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere\nof any o\ufb00ence in connection with the formation or management\nof any entity or business trust?\nNo\n\n(h)\nWhether he has ever been disqualified from acting as a director or an equivalent person of any entity (including the trustee of a business trust), or from taking part directly or indirectly in the management of any entity or business trust?

Writs of summons (cont\u2019d)\n(iv) On 13 April 2022, the Company filed an application in HC/SUM 1436/2022 (\u201cSUM 1436\u201d) for a summary determination of 2 questions of law. The e\ufb00ect of this application was to eliminate part of Mr. Smith\u2019s claim in the HC Suit, based on SUM 1436:\n(1) Section 168(1) of the Companies Act 1967 to prohibit part of Mr. Smith\u2019s claim under his then service agreement with the Company; and\n(2) Section 6(1) of the Limitation Act 1959 to bar all of Mr. Smith\u2019s claim against the Company that accrued on or before 25 February 2015.\nSUM 1436 was heard on 28 June, 27 July and 29 August 2022. On 28 September 2022, the General Division of the High Court ruled in favour of the Company on both questions. This significantly reduced Mr. Smith\u2019s claim in the HC Suit.\nSubsequently, Mr. Smith preliminarily indicated that his claim will be reduced to about $393,593. Mr. Smith will have to amend and re-calculate his claim.\nOn 9 January 2023, a judgement was received whereby Mr. Smith\u2019s action was dismissed and he shall be accountable for the costs incurred by the defendants amounting to $35,000 in total.\nOn 3 June 2023, the Company and Mr. Smith reached a full and final settlement of the legal proceedings without any admission as to liability (the \u201cSettlement\u201d). In accordance with the terms of the Settlement, the Company has agreed to pay Mr. Smith a total of $90,000 in three instalments: (1) $50,000 by 10 June 2023; (2) $20,000 by 10 July 2023; and (3) $20,000 by 10 August 2023. Further, an outstanding debt of $55,211 owing by Mr. Smith to the Company (together with all other interests accruing thereon and other costs associated therewith) arising from previous costs orders made by the Court in favour of the Company will be taken into account and deemed discharged by the Settlement.\nThe Board is of the view that the Settlement is in the best interests of the Group in view of the costs of litigation. In light of the Settlement, the Company and Mr. Smith filed the necessary documentation with the Court to discontinue the legal proceedings.\n34. Authorisation of financial statements\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company for the financial year ended 30 April 2023 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution by the Board of Directors on 14 September 2023.\n", "\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE\nThe Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of Renaissance United Limited (the \u201cCompany\u201d) and together with its subsidiaries, the (the \u201cGroup\u201d) is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance within the Group.

Compliance with these Principles is mandatory. These Principles set out broadly accepted characteristics of good corporate governance.\nThe Provisions that underpin the Principles are designed to support compliance with the Principles. Companies are expected to comply with the Provisions, and deviations from Provisions are acceptable to the extent they explicitly state and explain how their practices are consistent with the aim and philosophy of the Principle in question. The explanations of any deviation should be comprehensive and meaningful.\nCompanies are required to describe their corporate governance practices with reference to both the Principles and Provisions, and how their practices conform to the Principles and Provisions.\nThe emphasis of the Code is for companies to provide thoughtful and meaningful explanations around their practices, and for investors to consider these explanations as part of their engagement with companies. Frank and informed dialogue between companies and their shareholders is fundamental to good corporate governance and encourages more e\ufb00ective stewardship.\nCompliance with the Code\nThe Board confirms that, throughout the year, the Company has applied and complied, materially, with the Principles of the Code, as further enunciated by the Provisions, both in spirit and in form.

These risks include market risk (foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.\nThe Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nThere has been no change to the Group\u2019s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis indicated below.\nForeign exchange risk management\nThe Group is exposed to minimal foreign exchange rate risk as the financial assets and financial liabilities are mainly denominated in respective functional currency of the group entity. Any movement in foreign exchange rate is unlikely to have a significant impact in the results of the Group. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is prepared.\n", "NOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Financial Year Ended 30 June 2023\n30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, FINANCIAL RISKS AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\n30.3 Financial risk management policies and objectives (Continued)\nInterest rate risk management\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to fair value interest rate risk relates primarily to fixed deposits (Note 5), loan due to a shareholder (Note 4) and lease liabilities (Note 18). The Group\u2019s exposure to cash flow interest rate risk relates primarily to its variable-rate bank loans (Note 16). The Group manages interest by using a mixture of fixed and variable rate debts.\nInterest rate sensitivity analysis\nThe sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and on the assumption that the change took place at the beginning of the reporting period and is held constant throughout the reporting period. The magnitude represents management\u2019s assessment of the likely movement in interest rates under normal economic conditions.\nIf interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group\u2019s profit/(loss) before income tax for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 would have decreased or increase (2022: increased or decreased) by S$305,000 (2022: S$357,000).\nCredit risk management\nCredit risks refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. At the end of the reporting period, the Group\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk which will cause a financial loss to the Group due to failure to discharge an obligation by the counterparties and financial guarantees provided by the Group arises from:\n\n\u2022   the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial assets as stated in the consolidated statement of financial   position of the Group; and\n\u2022\nthe maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the financial guarantee is called upon, irrespective of the likelihood of the guarantee being exercised.\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk on receivables arising from the sale of industrial property units is not significant as such payments are usually arranged through loans taken up by customers with reputable financial institutions.\nRental deposits are received as security from tenants of its investment properties, and accordingly credit risk is limited in this aspect.\nFurther details of credit risks on trade and other receivables are disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements.\nThe Group also has concentration of credit risk by geographical location as all of the customers are located in Singapore.\nThe credit risk on bank balances and fixed deposits are limited because the counterparties are banks with good reputation and good credit rating.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG231002OTHRBHTH_Okh Global Ltd._20231002200549_00_AR_4Q_20230630.1.pdf", "page_number": [18, 21]}, {"question": "What is the GRI Standard Disclosure for Management of material topics?", "answer": "3-3", "raw_text": "What is the GRI Standard Disclosure for Management of material topics?\n###ANSWER: 3-3", "pages": ["SUSTAINAB ILIT Y\nREP ORT\nAPPENDIX GRI CONTENT INDEX\nStatement of use\nGRI 1 used Applicable GRI Sector Standard(s)\nGRI Standard Disclosure\nGeneral Disclosures\nGRI 2: General Disclosures 2021\n\n2-1 Organisational details\n2-2 Entities included in the organisation\u2019s sustainability reporting\n2-3 Reporting period, frequency and contact point\n2-4 Restatements of information\n2-5 External assurance\n2-6 Activities, value chain and other business relationships\n2-7 Employees\n2-8 Workers who are not employees\n\n2-9 Governance structure and composition\n2-10 Nomination and selection of the highest governance body\n2-11 Chair of the highest governance body\n2-12 Role of the highest governance body in overseeing the\nmanagement of impacts\n2-13 Delegation of responsibility for managing impacts\n2-14 Role of the highest governance body in sustainability reporting\n2-15 Conflicts of interest\n2-16 Communication of critical concerns\n2-17 Collective knowledge of the highest governance body\n2-18 Evaluation of the performance of the highest governance body\n2-19 Remuneration policies\n2-20 Process to determine remuneration\n2-21 Annual total compensation ratio\n\n2-22 Statement on sustainable development strategy\n2-23 Policy commitments\n2-24 Embedding policy commitments\n2-25 Processes to remediate negative impacts\n2-26 Mechanisms for seeking advice and raising concerns\n2-27 Compliance with laws and regulations\n2-28 Membership associations\n2-29 Approach to stakeholder engagement\n2-30 Collective bargaining agreements\nJapan Foods Holdings Ltd. has reported in accordance with the GRI Standards for the period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023.

The Share Purchase Mandate will expire on the date of the forthcoming AGM or the date by which the AGM is required by law to be held, whichever is earlier. Accordingly, the Directors propose that the Share Purchase Mandate be renewed at the forthcoming AGM.\nIf Shareholders approve the renewal of the Share Purchase Mandate, the Share Purchase Mandate will take effect from the date of the AGM and continue in force until the date on which the next annual general meeting of the Company is held or required by law to be held, unless prior thereto, Share Purchases are carried out to the full extent mandated or the Share Purchase Mandate is revoked or varied by Shareholders in general meeting. Subject to its continued relevance to the Company, the Share Purchase Mandate may be put to Shareholders for renewal at each subsequent annual general meetings of the Company.\n2.2 Rationale for the Share Purchase Mandate\nThe rationale for the Company to undertake the purchase or acquisition of its Shares, is as follows:\n(a) in line with international practice, the Share Purchase Mandate will provide the Company with greater flexibility in managing its capital and maximising return to its Shareholders. To the extent that the Company has capital and surplus funds which are in excess of its financial needs, taking into account its growth and expansion plans, the Share Purchase Mandate will facilitate the return of excess cash and surplus funds to Shareholders in an expedient, effective and cost-efficient manner;\n(b) in managing its business, the Group strives to increase Shareholders\u2019 value by improving, inter alia, the ROE and a share purchase is one way by which the ROE may be enhanced;\n(c) Share purchases may help mitigate short-term market volatility in the Company\u2019s share price, offset the effects of short-term speculation and bolster Shareholders\u2019 confidence;\n(d) all things being equal, purchases or acquisitions of Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate will result in a lower number of issued Shares being used for the purpose of computing EPS, if the purchased Shares are subsequently cancelled. Therefore, Share Purchases will improve the Company\u2019s EPS, which in turn is expected to have a positive impact on the fundamental value of the Shares; and\n(e) the Share Purchase Mandate will provide the Company with the flexibility to undertake share repurchases at any time, subject to market conditions, during the period when the Share Purchase Mandate is in force.\nThe purchase or acquisition of Shares will only be undertaken if it can benefit the Company and Shareholders. Shareholders should note that purchases or acquisitions of Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate may not be carried out to the full limit as authorised. No purchase or acquisition of Shares will be made in circumstances which would have or may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and capital adequacy position of the Group as a whole.\n2.3 Authority and Limits of the Share Purchase Mandate\nThe authority and limitations placed on purchases or acquisitions of Shares by the Company under the Share Purchase Mandate are summarised below:\n2.3.1 Maximum Number of Shares\nOnly Shares which are issued and fully paid-up may be purchased or acquired by the Company. The total number of Shares which may be purchased or acquired by the Company pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate shall not exceed ten per cent (10%) of the total number of issued Shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares and Subsidiary Holdings) as at the date on which the resolution authorising the Share Purchase Mandate is passed.\n", "APPENDIX\n2.3.2 Duration of Authority\nPurchases or acquisitions of Shares may be made, at any time and from time to time, on and from the date of the AGM, at which the Share Purchase Mandate is approved, up to the earliest of:\n(a) the date on which the next annual general meeting of the Company is held or required by law to be held;\n(b)\n\nthe date on which the purchases or acquisitions of Shares by the Company pursuant to the Share\nPurchase Mandate are carried out to the full extent mandated; or\n(c) the date on which the authority conferred by the Share Purchase Mandate is revoked or varied by Shareholders in general meeting.\nThe Share Purchase Mandate may be renewed at each annual general meeting or other general meetings of the Company.\n2.3.3 Manner of Purchases or Acquisitions of Shares\nPurchases or acquisitions of Shares may be made by way of:\n(a) on-market purchase(s) (\u201cMarket Purchase\u201d), transacted on Catalist through the ready market or the special trading counter on SGX\u2011ST trading system, through one or more duly licensed stock brokers appointed by the Company for the purpose; and/or\n(b) off-market purchase(s) (\u201cOff-Market Purchase\u201d) effected pursuant to an equal access scheme as defined in Section 76C of the Companies Act and the Catalist Rules.\nThe Directors may impose such terms and conditions which are not inconsistent with the Share Purchase Mandate, the Catalist Rules and the Companies Act, as they consider fit in the interests of the Company in connection with or in relation to any equal access scheme or schemes.\nAn Off-Market Purchase must, however, satisfy all the following conditions:\n(i)\n\noffers for the purchase or acquisition of Shares shall be made to every person who holds Shares to\npurchase or acquire the same percentage of their Shares;\n(ii) all of the abovementioned persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to accept the offers made; and\n(iii) the terms of all the offers shall be the same, except that there shall be disregarded:\n(a)\n\ndifferences in consideration attributable to the fact that offers may relate to Shares with different\naccrued dividend entitlements;\n(b)\n\ndifferences in consideration attributable to the fact that offers relate to Shares with different\namounts remaining unpaid (if applicable); and\n(c) differences in the offers introduced solely to ensure that each person is left with a whole number of Shares.\nIf the Company wishes to make an Off-Market Purchase in accordance with an equal access scheme, it will issue an offer document containing the following information:\n(1) the terms and conditions of the offer;\n(2) the period and procedures for acceptances;\n(3) the reasons for the proposed Share Purchases;\n(4) the consequences, if any, of Share Purchases by the Company that will arise under the Take-over Code or other applicable take-over rules;\n", "APPENDIX\n(5) whether the Share Purchases, if made, could affect the Company\u2019s equity securities on Catalist;\n(6) details of any Share Purchases made by the Company in the previous twelve (12) months (whether Market Purchase or Off-Market Purchase), giving the total number of Shares purchased, the purchase price per Share or the highest and lowest prices paid for the Share Purchases, where relevant, and the total consideration paid for the Share Purchases; and\n(7) whether the Shares purchased by the Company will be cancelled or kept as treasury shares.\n2.3.4 Purchase Price\nThe purchase price (excluding brokerage, commission, applicable goods and services tax and other related expenses) to be paid for the Shares will be determined by the Directors. The purchase price to be paid for the Shares as determined by the Directors must not exceed:\n(a) in the case of a Market Purchase, 105% of the Average Closing Price of the Shares; and\n(b) in the case of an Off-Market Purchase pursuant to an equal access scheme, 120% of the Average Closing Price of the Shares,\nin each case, excluding related expenses of the purchase, or acquisition (the \u201cMaximum Price\u201d).\nFor the above purposes:\n\u201cAverage Closing Price\u201d means the average of the closing market prices of a Share over the last five (5) Market Days on which the Shares are transacted on the SGX\u2011ST immediately preceding the date of the Market Purchase by the Company or, as the case may be, the date of the making of the offer (as defined below) pursuant to the Off-Market Purchase, and deemed to be adjusted for any corporate action that occurs during the relevant five- day period and the day on which the purchases are made; and\n\u201cdate of the making of the offer\u201d means the date on which the Company makes an offer for the purchase or acquisition of Shares from holder of Shares, stating therein the relevant terms of the equal access scheme for effecting the Off-Market Purchase.\n2.4 Status of Purchased Shares\nPursuant to Regulation 20, Shares purchased or acquired by the Company pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate, unless held as treasury shares to the extent permitted under the Companies Act, will be deemed cancelled immediately on purchase or acquisition (and all rights and privileges attached to the Shares will expire on such cancellation). The total number of issued Shares will be diminished by the number of Shares purchased or acquired by the Company and which are not held as treasury shares.\nAll Shares purchased or acquired by the Company (other than treasury shares held by the Company to the extent permitted under the Companies Act) will be automatically de-listed by the SGX\u2011ST, and certificates in respect thereof will be cancelled and destroyed by the Company as soon as reasonably practicable following settlement of any such purchase or acquisition.\n2.5 Treasury Shares\nUnder the Companies Act, Shares purchased or acquired by the Company may be held or dealt with as treasury shares. Some of the provisions on treasury shares under the Companies Act are summarised in Paragraphs 2.5.1 to 2.5.3 below.\n2.5.1 Maximum Holdings\nThe number of Shares held as treasury shares cannot at any time exceed 10% of the total number of issued Shares.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230714OTHRXUIE_Kop Limited_20230714202221_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [30, 33]}, {"question": "Who are the children of Mr. Tan Tum Beng, the founder of the Group?", "answer": "Mr. Tan Tin Yeow and Ms. Tan Guat Lian", "raw_text": "Who are the children of Mr. Tan Tum Beng, the founder of the Group?\n###ANSWER:\nMr. Tan Tin Yeow and Ms. Tan Guat Lian", "pages": ["\nADDENDUM TO ANNUAL REPORT\n2.9 Take-over Obligations\nAppendix 2 of the Take-over Code contains the Share Buyback Guidance Note applicable as at the Latest Practicable Date.

(\u201cJubilee\u201d and together with its subsidiary corporations, the \u201cGroup\u201d) recorded a revenue of S$22.4 million from continuing operation relating only to the Mechanical Business Unit (\u201cMBU\u201d), a decrease of S$8.0 million or 26.3% as compared to S$30.4 million for the financial year ended 31 March 2022 (\u201cFY2022\u201d).\nThis was attributed mainly to slower demand in plastic injection amidst intense competition from alternative materials and currency exchange losses amidst a weakening Singapore Dollar. Furthermore, manufacturing activity slowed given the continued economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions amidst a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, resulting in weaker customer demand.\nThe market supply of resin, which is a key raw material for the Group\u2019s MBU remained tight throughout FY2023 due to logistics issues exacerbated by labour shortages and rising inflation. As a result, the MBU\u2019s cost of sales exceeded its revenue marginally by S$0.4 million, resulting in a negative gross profit margin of 1.8% as compared to a gross profit margin of 2.8% recorded for FY2022.\nOther income increased by S$0.4 million from S$0.1 million for FY2022 to S$0.5 million for FY2023 mainly due to the reversal of employee benefit following regulatory changes in Indonesia.\nOther gains for FY2023 amounted to S$1.9 million, reversing the other losses of S$2.1 million recorded for FY2022. The reversal was mainly due to the absence of fair value loss on financial assets, at fair value through profit or loss (\u201cFVPL\u201d) for FY2023 and the gain on disposal of financial assets at FVPL of S$1.6 million for FY2023 following the sale of the Group\u2019s EG Industries Berhad shares.\nDistribution and marketing expenses remained steady at S$0.3 million while administrative expenses increased by S$0.4 million from S$3.8 million for FY2022 to S$4.2 million for FY2023 due to higher professional fees.\nFinance expenses decreased by S$0.1 million from S$0.2 million for FY2022 to S$0.1 million for FY2023 due to a decrease in borrowing commitments compared to the prior year.\nAs a result of the above, the Group narrowed its net loss after tax from S$5.5 million for FY2022 to a net loss after tax from continuing operation of S$2.7 million for FY2023.\nThe Group\u2019s Electronic Business Unit (\u201cEBU\u201d) was classified separately from the Group\u2019s turnover as discontinued operations, as the disposal of the EBU was completed on 29 August 2023 following shareholder approval. In accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards, the EBU\u2019s financial performance was presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and segment reporting section as discontinued operations, separate from the Group\u2019s revenue.\nFinancial Position\nThe Group\u2019s current assets decreased by S$9.8 million from S$65.0 as at 31 March 2022 to S$55.2 million as at 31 March 2023. This was mainly attributed to the Group\u2019s sale of financial assets at FVPL amounting to S$7.0 million. The current and non-current assets of the Group\u2019s EBU and Honfoong Plastic Industries Pte Ltd, which forms part of the Group\u2019s MBU (\u201cHF \u2013 MBU\u201d), were presented as \u201cAssets of disposal group classified as held for sale\u201d.\nNon-current assets decreased by S$7.8 million from S$8.5 million as at 31 March 2022 to S$0.7 million as at 31 March 2023. This was primarily due to reclassification of property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets to disposal group classified as held for sale.\nCurrent liabilities decreased by S$11.4 million from S$45.6 million as at 31 March 2022 to S$34.2 million as at 31 March 2023. This was primarily due to the drop in liabilities directly associated with the disposal group classified as held for sale, namely the Group\u2019s EBU and HF \u2013 MBU.\nThe Group\u2019s working capital increased by S$1.6 million from S$19.4 million as at 31 March 2022 to S$21.0 million as at 31 March 2023.\nAs a result of the above, the Group\u2019s net assets decreased by S$6.0 million from S$27.6 million as at 31 March 2022 to S$21.6 million as at 31 March 2023.\n", "\nOPERATIONS AND\nCash Flow Statement\nNet cash generated from operating activities for FY2023 was S$1.3 million, reversing the net cash used from operating activities of S$2.7 million recorded for FY2022. The reversal was mainly due to movement in inventory level.\nNet cash generated from investing activities of S$11.7 million for FY2023 was mainly due to proceeds from the disposal of investments in financial assets at FVPL and partial disposal of subsidiary.\nNet cash used in financing activities for FY2023 was S$3.7 million which was attributed to the repayment of bank borrowings and loan from non-related party.\nAs a result of the above, the Group\u2019s cash and cash equivalents increased by S$9.3 million from S$4.1 million as at 31 March 2022 to S$13.4 million as at 31 March 2023.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\n", "MILESTONE\nFY\n2023\nFY\n2022\nFY\n2021\nFY\n2020\nFY\n2019\nFY\n2018\nFY\n2017\nFY\n2016\nFY\n2015\nJubilee welcomes new strategic investor, pursues asset monetisation to unlock value for shareholders\nJubilee achieves record revenue, exceeding the S$200 million mark for the first time\nJubilee bounced back from the initial impact of Covid-19, achieved higher revenue and gross profit\nSecured new revenue opportunities amidst trade tensions, MBU achieved continued growth\nSuccessfully sustained turnaround, net profit tripled\nAcquired Honfoong Plastics Industries Pte.

In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHROF7U_Boustead Projects Limited_20230705072347_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [78, 81]}, {"question": "How many Board and Board Committees\u2019 meetings were held in FY2023?", "answer": "14", "raw_text": "How many Board and Board Committees\u2019 meetings were held in FY2023?\n###ANSWER:\n14", "pages": ["CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nThe Company recognises the importance of ongoing professional development for the Board members. Depending on each Director\u2019s background and development needs, the Directors are provided with opportunities to develop and maintain their skills and knowledge, particularly on applicable new laws, regulations, as well as trainings in areas such as accounting, legal and industry-specific knowledge, as appropriate, at the Company\u2019s expense. Directors are encouraged to attend training courses organised by the SID or other training institutions in connection with their duties as Directors on an on-going basis, at the Company\u2019s expense. If required, briefings by external consultants or professional parties are also organised for the Board.\nDuring FY2023, the Management has kept the Directors apprised on pertinent developments in the business of the Group during Board and/or Board committee meetings to facilitate the discharge of their duties. The Board is also provided with information and updates on the Group\u2019s policies and procedures relating to issues pertaining to governance, disclosure of interests in securities and restrictions on disclosure of price sensitive information, changes in reporting standards and issues which have a direct impact on financial statements, so as to enable them to properly discharge their duties and responsibilities as Board members or Board committee members.\nDuring FY2023, some Directors attended third party-run programmes such as those organised by the SID, the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and other professional bodies. Regular updates were also provided by the external auditors on any applicable new or revised financial reporting standards.\nPursuant to Catalist Rule 720(6), all the Directors have attended the required training on sustainability matters as prescribed by the SGX- ST in FY2023 and prior to the issuance of this Report.

The matters requiring Board\u2019s approval include (but are not limited to) the following:\n(a) Annual budgets and business plan of the Group; (b)\nMaterial acquisition and disposal of assets/investment; (c)\nCorporate/financial restructuring and corporate exercise; (d)\nIssuances of shares, dividend pay-out and other returns to Shareholders; (e)\nInterested persons transactions; (f)\nSGX-ST announcements and release of annual reports; and (g)\nAny other matters as prescribed by relevant legislations and regulations, as well as the provisions of the Company\u2019s Constitution.\nTo optimise operational efficiencies, the Company has also adopted a guideline and policy setting out financial operations authorisation and approval limits. These are periodically reviewed for operating and capital expenditure and the procurement of goods and services. The Board approves transactions exceeding certain threshold amounts while delegating authority to the Management for transactions below such limits.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nProvision 1.4 Delegation of Authority to Board Committees\nTo facilitate effective management, the Board has delegated certain functions to the Board committees, namely, the:\n(a) Audit and Risk Committee (\u201cARC\u201d); (b)\nRemuneration Committee (\u201cRC\u201d); and (c)\nNominating Committee (\u201cNC\u201d),\n(collectively, the \u201cBoard Committees\u201d),\nto ensure that there are appropriate checks and balances.

Board and Board Committee meetings are planned and scheduled well in advance at the beginning of each year in consultation with the Directors to facilitate meaningful participation and to ensure optimal attendance.\nAd-hoc meetings are convened when circumstances require, to discuss pressing matters which require the Board\u2019s deliberation and decision in between the scheduled meetings. The Company\u2019s Constitution (the \u201cConstitution\u201d) and terms of references for each committee provide for participation in meetings via audio or visual means. In between regularly scheduled meetings, matters that require the Board and/or Board Committees\u2019 approval are circulated to all Directors and/or respective Board Committee members, as the case may be, for their consideration by way of circular resolutions.\nWhen considering the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple listed company board representations and/or other principal commitments, the NC reviews the time spent and attention given by each of the Directors to the Company\u2019s affairs, and to assess the adequacy of all Directors in discharging their duties for FY2023.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nThe number of Board and Board Committees\u2019 meetings held in FY2023 and the attendance of each Director at such meetings are set out below:\n\n | Board | ARC   NC   RC | AGM\nTotal number of Meetings Held   Name of Director | 4 | 5   2   2   Number of Meetings Attended | 1\nTakahashi Kenichi | 4 | NA   NA   NA | 1\nWong Hin Sun, Eugene | 4 | 5   2   2 | 1\nLee Sok Koon, Constance | 4 | 5   2   2 | 1\nTan Lye Huat   (a) | 4 | 5   2   NA | 1\nChia Siok Mei, Sylvia | 4 | 5   1   1 | 1\nTan Cher Ting   (b) | NA | NA   NA   NA | NA\nNA: not applicable (a)\nMr Tan Lye Huat ceased to be a Director with effect from 3 March 2023.

The take-over implications arising from any purchase or acquisition by the Company of its Shares are set out below.\n2.9.1 Obligation to make a take-over offer\nIf, as a result of any purchase or acquisition by the Company of the Shares, the proportionate interest in the voting capital of the Company of a Shareholder and persons acting in concert with him increases, such increase will be treated as an acquisition for the purposes of Rule 14 of the Take-over Code. Consequently, a Shareholder or a group of Shareholders acting in concert with a Director could obtain or consolidate effective control of the Company and become obliged to make an offer under Rule 14 of the Take-over Code.\n2.9.2 Persons acting in concert\nUnder the Take-over Code, persons acting in concert (\u201cconcert parties\u201d) comprise individuals or companies who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal), cooperate, through the acquisition by any of them of shares in a company, to obtain or consolidate effective control of the company.\nUnless the contrary is established, the Take-over Code presumes, inter alia, the following individuals and companies to be persons acting in concert:\n(a) a company with its parent company, its subsidiaries, its fellow subsidiaries, any associated companies of the foregoing companies, any company whose associated companies include any of the foregoing companies, and any person who has provided financial assistance (other than a bank in the ordinary course of business) to any of the foregoing for the purchase of voting rights;\n(b) a company with any of its directors, together with their close relatives, related trusts and any companies controlled by any of the directors, their close relatives and related trusts;\n(c) a company with any of its pension funds and employee share schemes;\n(d) a person with any investment company, unit trust or other fund whose investment such person manages on a discretionary basis, but only in respect of the investment account which such person manages;\n(e) a financial or other professional adviser, including a stockbroker, with its client in respect of the shareholdings of the adviser and persons controlling, controlled by or under the same control as the adviser;\n(f) directors of a company, together with their close relatives, related trusts and companies controlled by any of them, which is subject to an offer or where the directors have reason to believe a bona fide offer for their company may be imminent;\n(g) partners; and\n", "APPENDIX\n2.

In calculating the percentages of voting rights of such Directors and their concert parties, treasury shares shall be excluded.\nUnder Appendix 2 of the Take-over Code, a Shareholder not acting in concert with the Directors will not be required to make a take-over offer under Rule 14 if, as a result of the Company purchasing or acquiring its Shares, the voting rights of such Shareholder would increase to 30% or more, or, if such Shareholder holds between 30% and 50% of the Company\u2019s voting rights, the voting rights of such Shareholder would increase by more than 1% in any period of 6 months. Such Shareholder need not abstain from voting in respect of the resolution authorising the Share Buyback Mandate.\nBased on the information in the Company\u2019s Register of Shareholders as at the Latest Practicable Date, none of the Directors or Substantial Shareholders of the Company are obliged to make a general offer to other Shareholders under Rule 14 and Appendix 2 of the Take-over Code as a result of a purchase or acquisition of Shares by the Company pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate.

The AC assists the Board in providing oversight of risk management in the Company. It is responsible for reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group\u2019s risk management systems and internal controls and reporting to the Board annually its observations and on any matters under its purview as well as, where necessary, making recommendations to the Board as it deems fit.\nThe AC ensures that a review of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls and risk management framework is conducted at least once a year.\nThe Management has taken note of the recommendations made by the internal auditors and the Board would implement necessary procedures and processes to further strengthen the internal controls. The Board is not aware of any material inadequacy in the overall internal controls and processes currently in place.\nThe Board has received assurance from the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Accrelist Ltd. (the holding company of Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd.) that the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Company\u2019s operations and finances.\nIn addition, the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the key management personnel who are responsible have also given assurance to the Board regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company\u2019s risk management and internal control systems.\nBased on the work performed by the internal auditors and external auditors during the financial year and the assurance from the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer (Accrelist Ltd.), the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the system of internal controls and risk management in place are adequate and effective to address the financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks and risk management system for the type and volume of business that the Group currently operates and has confirmed that the Company is not aware of any sanctions related risks or any risks of the Company being subject to sanctions for the current financial year. The system of internal controls and risk management established by the Group provides reasonable assurance that the Group will not be adversely affected by any event that can be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. However, the Board also notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision- making, human errors, losses, fraud or other irregularities.\nThe independent auditors, during the conduct of their normal audit procedures, may also report on matters relating to internal controls.

There were no non-audit services provided by Moore Stephens LLP.\nThe Board recognises the importance of maintaining a system of internal control processes to safeguard Shareholders\u2019 investments and the Group\u2019s business and assets. The Board notes that no system of internal control could provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgment in decision-making, human error, losses, fraud or other irregularities. The annual conduct of audits by the internal auditors assesses the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control procedures and provides reasonable assurance to the AC and the Management that the Group\u2019s risk management, controls and governance processes are adequate and effective.\nThe Board is satisfied that the internal audit function is independent, has adequate resources to perform its function effectively and is staffed by suitably qualified and experienced professionals with the relevant experience. The AC will also approve the hiring, removal, evaluation and compensation of the accounting or auditing firm or corporation to which the internal audit function of the Company is outsourced to.\nThe AC has outsourced the performance of the internal audit functions of the Group to NLA Risk Consulting Pte. Ltd. The internal auditors will report directly to the AC and administratively to the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. To ensure the adequacy of the internal audit function, the AC had reviewed and approved the internal audit plan before the internal audit commenced. The AC, on an annual basis, will assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal audit and the internal auditors\u2019 independence, the qualification and experiences of internal audit team assigned and the internal auditors\u2019 reports and its relationship with the internal auditors. The AC conducted a review and concluded that the internal audit function is adequately resourced, effective and has appropriate standing within the Group. The internal auditors have unfettered access to all the Company\u2019s documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the Board, the AC and the Management to perform their internal audit review, where necessary, and have the right to seek information and explanation.\nThe internal audit work carried out in FY2023 was guided by the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing laid down in the International Professional Practices Framework issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors.\nThe Whistle Blowing Policy which was endorsed by the AC and adopted on 20 May 2011 encourages employees and external parties to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible irregularities in matters of financial reporting or other matters, to the whistle- blowing officers, members of the AC. It aims to provide an avenue for employees and external parties to raise concerns and offer reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in good faith within the limits of the law. Details of the whistle-blowing policy and procedure for whistle blowing have been made available to all employees of the Group and external parties.\nThe AC oversees the administration of the whistle blowing policy. Periodic reports will be submitted to the AC stating the number and the complaints received, the results of the investigations, follow-up actions and unresolved complaints. The AC has the responsibility to ensure there is proper maintenance, regular review and relevant updates of the policy. Revisions, amendments and alterations to the whistle blowing policy are subject to the approval of the AC and the Board prior to implementation. Changes will be notified in writing to the employees when they are implemented.\nFor FY2023, the AC and the Board noted that there were no reports whistle blowing received and no incidents in relation to whistle blowing matters have been raised during the year by any staff to indicate possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting, financial control, or any other matters.\nThe AC meets regularly with the Management and both independent and internal auditors to review auditing and risk management matters and discuss the accounting implications of any major transactions including significant financial reporting issues. It also reviews the internal audit program of the Group to ensure that an effective system of control is maintained in the Group to align it to the changing needs and risk profile of the Group\u2019s activities. On a semi-annual basis, the AC reviews the interested persons transactions and the financial results announcement before their submission to the Board for approval. In the event that a member of the Audit Committee is interested in any matter being considered by the AC, he will abstain from reviewing that particular transaction or voting on that particular resolution.\nThe AC is kept abreast by the Management, the independent auditors and the Company Secretary of changes to accounting standards, Catalist Rules and other regulations which would have an impact on the Group\u2019s business and financial statements.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230926OTHRI4T0_Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd._20230926175412_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [33, 36]}, {"question": "What is the net book value of the Group's property, plant and equipment as at 31 March 2023?", "answer": "$981,000", "raw_text": "What is the net book value of the Group's property, plant and equipment as at 31 March 2023?\n###ANSWER:\n$981,000", "pages": ["Notes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n16.

Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.\nThe customer is invoiced based on a payment schedule which is typically triggered upon achievement of specified construction milestones. If the value of the goods transferred by the Group exceeds the payments, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the value of the goods transferred, a contract liability is recognised. The accounting policy for contract assets and contract liabilities is set out above.\nHospitality income\nRevenue from serviced apartment operations is recognised at the point when the accommodation and related services are rendered.\nRental income\nRental income from investment property is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of lease.

Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\nGovernment grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.\nFINANCE INCOME AND COSTS \u2013 The Group\u2019s finance income comprises interest income on cash balances and finance costs comprises interest expense on leases and borrowings and amortisation of transaction costs on borrowings.\nInterest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method.\nThe \u2018effective interest rate\u2019 is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:\nthe gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or l\nthe amortised cost of the financial liability. l\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n", "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT\u2019D)\nBorrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\nTAX \u2013 Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\nThe Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under SFRS(I)\n1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.\nDeferred tax is not recognised for:\n\ntemporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a\nbusiness combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and\nl\ntemporary differences related to investment in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. l\nThe measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.\n", "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT\u2019D)\nEARNINGS PER SHARE \u2013 The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nSEGMENT REPORTING \u2013 An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group\u2019s other components. All operating segments\u2019 operating results are reviewed regularly by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.\nSegment results that are reported to the Board of Directors include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and equipment.\n3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I)s requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\nInformation about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in Note 5 \u2013 classification of property as property, plant and equipment.\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year, are described in the following notes:\n\nl | Note 2 | \u2013 | estimation of provisions for current and deferred taxation\nl | Note 5 | \u2013 | impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment\nl | Note 8 | \u2013 | allowance for foreseeable losses on development properties\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHRRJJJ_Bukit Sembawang Estates Limited_20230705172059_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [66, 69]}, {"question": "Who is the Chairman of Audit Committee of Versalink Holdings Limited?", "answer": "Sho Kian Hin", "raw_text": "Who is the Chairman of Audit Committee of Versalink Holdings Limited?\n###ANSWER: Sho Kian Hin", "pages": ["STATEMENT BY DIRECTORS\nThe PSP shall continue in force at the discretion of the remuneration committee, subject to a maximum period of 10 years commencing on the date on which the PSP is adopted by the company in the general meeting, provided always that the PSP may continue beyond the above stipulated period with the approval of the shareholders by ordinary resolution in the general meeting and of any relevant authorities which may then be required.\nThe total number of shares over which the remuneration committee may grant the options under the PSP and the total number of shares which may be delivered pursuant to the vesting of awards under the PSP on any date, when added to the aggregate number of shares issued and/or issuable in respect of (i) all options granted under the ESOS; (ii) all awards granted under the PSP; and (iii) all outstanding options, shares or awards issued and/or issuable or granted under such other share-based incentive schemes or share plans of the company, shall not exceed 15% of the total number of issued shares (including treasury shares, as dened in the Act) of the company on the day immediat preceding the offer date of the option or from time to time.\nDuring the reporting year, no option to take up unissued shares of the company or any corporation in the group was granted and there were no shares of the company or any corporation in the group issued by virtue of the exercise of an option to take up unissued shares.\nAt the end of the reporting year, there were no unissued shares of the company or any corporation in the group under option.\nDuring the reporting year, no shares were issued pursuant to the ESOS and PSP.\n6.

The carrying amount of inventories may not be recoverable in full if those inventories become slow moving, or if their selling prices have declined below carrying amounts.\nThe estimate of allowance for obsolete inventories is based on the age of these inventories, prevailing market conditions in the system furniture industry and historical provisioning experience which requires management judgement. Management applies particular judgement in the areas relating to inventory allowance based on inventory aging. This methodology relies upon assumption made in determining appropriate allowance of inventories.\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\nFor samples selected, our audit procedures included, among others (i) checking the net realisable value of the inventories by comparing cost to subsequent selling prices; (ii) reviewing the inventory turnover days and aging of the inventories to assess if there were any signicant built up of aged inventories; and (iii) assessing the reasonable allowance for inventory obsolescence.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230612OTHRAZAY_Versalink Holdings Limited_20230612181356_00_AR_4Q_20230228.1.pdf", "page_number": [48, 51]}, {"question": "Who is the Share Registrar for Travelite Holdings Ltd.?", "answer": "Tricor Services Limited", "raw_text": "Who is the Share Registrar for Travelite Holdings Ltd.?\n###ANSWER: Tricor Services Limited", "pages": ["Notice of Annual General Meeting\nA shareholder who is a relevant intermediary is entitled to appoint more than two proxies to attend and vote at the AGM, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different Share or Shares held by such shareholder.

In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances \u0096 e.g., when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.\nThe above ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because they create a right of set-off of recognised amounts that is enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties. In addition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\nThe Group also enters into netting arrangements with International Air Transport Association (\u0093IATA\u0094) which is enforceable in the normal course of operations and also following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties.

The Group\u0092s airline operations carry certain financial and commodity risks, including the effects of changes in jet fuel prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of its investments. The Group\u0092s overall risk management approach is to moderate the effects of such volatility on its financial performance through the use of derivatives to hedge specific exposures.\nAs derivatives are used for the purpose of risk management, they do not expose the Group to market risk because gains and losses on the derivatives offset losses and gains on the matching asset, liability, revenues or expenses being hedged. Moreover, counterparty credit risk is generally restricted to any hedging gain from time to time, and not the principal amount hedged. Therefore, the possibility of a material loss arising in the event of non-performance by a counterparty is considered to be unlikely.\nFinancial risk management policies are periodically reviewed and approved by the Board Executive Committee (\u0093BEC\u0094).\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the Financial Year ended 31 March 2023\n41 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (in $ million) (continued)\nDerivative financial instruments included in the statements of financial position are as follows:\n\nThe Group   31 March |  | The Company   31 March | \n2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022\nDerivative assets Current\n\nCurrency hedging contracts | 27.6 | 0.2 | 27.6 | 0.2\nFuel hedging contracts | 98.5 | 675.4 | 98.5 | 675.4\nFuel derivative contracts | 444.3 | 710.6 | 444.3 | 710.6\nCross currency swap contracts | 11.1 | 10.3 | 11.1 | 10.3\nInterest rate swap contracts | 81.2 | 5.5 | 78.3 | 5.5\n | 662.7 | 1,402.0 | 659.8 | 1,402.0\nNon-current\n\nFuel hedging contracts | 0.7 | 153.4 | 0.7 | 153.4\nFuel derivative contracts | 318.3 | 1,204.4 | 318.3 | 1,204.4\nCross currency swap contracts | 26.7 | 19.7 | 26.7 | 19.7\nInterest rate swap contracts | 188.9 | 159.8 | 185.7 | 158.5\n | 534.6 | 1,537.3   2,939.3 | 531.4 | 1,536.0   2,938.0\nDerivative liabilities Current\n\nCurrency hedging contracts | 10.5 | \u0096 | 10.5 | \u0096\nFuel hedging contracts | 29.9 | \u0096 | 29.9 | \u0096\nFuel derivative contracts | 358.4 | 558.5 | 358.4 | 558.5\nInterest rate swap contracts | 0.2 | 16.2 | 0.2 | 12.6\n | 399.0 | 574.7 | 399.0 | 571.1\nNon-current\n\nFuel hedging contracts | 6.8 | \u0096 | 6.8 | \u0096\nFuel derivative contracts | 263.6 | 1,073.3 | 263.6 | 1,073.3\nCross currency swap contracts | 53.4 | 2.4 | 53.4 | 2.4\nInterest rate swap contracts | \u0096 | 0.2 | \u0096 | 0.2\n | 323.8   722.8 | 1,075.9   1,650.6 | 323.8   722.8 | 1,075.9   1,647.0\n(a) Jet fuel price risk\nThe Group\u0092s earnings are affected by changes in the price of jet fuel. The Group\u0092s strategy for managing the risk on fuel price, as defined by the BEC, aims to provide the Group with protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel prices. In meeting these objectives, the fuel risk management programme allows for the judicious use of approved instruments such as swaps, options and collars with approved counterparties and within approved credit limits to hedge approved range of anticipated jet fuel purchases over a specified time frame.\nCash flow hedges\nThe Group manages this fuel price risk by using jet fuel swap, ICE Brent swap and Brent-MOPS crack swap contracts.\nThe Group has applied cash flow hedge accounting to the derivatives which are considered to be highly effective hedging instruments. A net fair value gain before tax of $203.1 million (2022: gain before tax of $1,089.2 million), with a related deferred tax expense of $34.6 million (2022: deferred tax expense of $185.2 million), was included in the fair value reserve in respect of these contracts.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a significant reduction in the Group\u0092s capacity and hence fuel consumption, compared to prior planned flight schedules. Where the occurrences of these forecasted jet fuel purchases are no longer highly probable, hedge accounting has been discontinued.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230628OTHRO5FL_Singapore Airlines Limited_20230628081920_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [39, 42]}, {"question": "Who is the Executive Chairman of Azeus Systems Holdings Ltd.?", "answer": "Lee Wan Lik", "raw_text": "Who is the Executive Chairman of Azeus Systems Holdings Ltd.?\n###ANSWER: Lee Wan Lik", "pages": ["LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\nUnder Appendix 2 of the Take-over Code, a Shareholder not acting in concert with the Directors of the Company will not be required to make a take-over offer under Rule 14 if, as a result of the Company purchasing or acquiring its Shares, (a) the voting rights of such Shareholder in the Company would increase to 30% or more, or (b) (if such Shareholder holds between 30% and 50% of the Company\u2019s voting rights) the voting rights of such Shareholder would increase by more than 1% in any period of six (6) months.

The sub-lease term for the aircraft is between four and five years.\nBAH Group sub-leased two A320-200 aircraft to an external party. The sub-lease term for the aircraft is between eight and nine years.\nFuture minimum lease receivables under the finance leases are as follows:\nThe Group 31 March\n\n2023 | 2022\n\nWithin 1 year | 47.2 | 9.1\n1 - 2 years | 39.3 | 3.8\n2 - 3 years | 31.2 | \u0096\nTotal undiscounted lease receivables | 117.7 | 12.9\nUnearned finance income | (7.0) | (0.4)\nNet investment in the lease | 110.7 | 12.5\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the Financial Year ended 31 March 2023\n39 Contingent Liabilities (in $ million)\n(a) Cargo: Investigations by Competition Authorities and Civil Class Actions\nIn 2006 and thereafter, SIA Cargo and the Company were among several airlines that received notice of investigations by competition authorities in the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea and Switzerland as to whether surcharges, rates or other competitive aspects of air cargo service were lawfully determined (the \u0093air cargo issues\u0094).\nOn 9 November 2010, the European Commission issued an adverse decision against 13 air cargo airlines, including SIA Cargo and the Company, in respect of fuel surcharges, security surcharges and commissions on surcharges. A fine of EUR74.8 million ($135.7 million) was imposed on SIA Cargo and the Company. SIA Cargo paid the fine in February 2011 in accordance with European Union laws. This amount was reflected as an exceptional item in the Group\u0092s accounts in FY2010/11. SIA Cargo and the Company filed an appeal to the European General Court seeking annulment of the decision. In December 2015, the European General Court annulled the decision of the European Commission in its entirety vis-\u00e0-vis SIA Cargo and the Company. In February 2016, EUR76.4 million ($119.1 million) comprising the fine amount and returns thereon was refunded to SIA Cargo. This refund was recognised as a non-operating item in the Group\u0092s FY2015/16 accounts. In March 2017, the European Commission re-adopted a decision in respect of the same case against the air cargo airlines, imposing a fine of EUR74.8 million ($111.8 million) against SIA Cargo and the Company. This amount was recognised as a non-operating item in the Group\u0092s accounts in FY2016/17. SIA Cargo and the Company have filed an appeal to the European General Court seeking annulment of the re-adopted decision. In March 2022, the European General Court has issued its decision, dismissing the appeal by SIA Cargo and the Company. In June 2022, SIA Cargo and the Company filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice against the decision of the European General Court.\nIn January 2014, the Swiss Competition Commission announced a fine against SIA Cargo and the Company of CHF1.7 million ($2.3 million) in respect of the air cargo issues. This amount was reflected as an exceptional item in the Group\u0092s accounts in FY2013/14. SIA Cargo and the Company have filed an appeal to the Swiss Federal Administrative Tribunal seeking annulment of the decision. In December 2022, the tribunal partially allowed the appeal, reducing the fine amount to CHF1.4 million ($2.1 million). SIA and the Company filed an appeal to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court against the decision of the Swiss Federal Administrative Tribunal.\nThe proceedings by competition authorities in the United States, South Korea, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand were resolved in previous financial periods.\nAfter the investigations commenced, civil damage lawsuits were filed in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Korea, England, the Netherlands, Norway and Germany by private parties against several airlines, including SIA Cargo and the Company. Other lawsuits have been threatened by customers of SIA Cargo or shippers that purportedly contracted with SIA Cargo\u0092s customers.\nThe plaintiffs in the South Korea proceedings withdrew their complaint in July 2011 and the proceedings were accordingly dismissed without prejudice. In January 2014, a shipper from South Korea which purportedly contracted with SIA Cargo\u0092s customers served a claim against SIA Cargo and other airlines. In December 2019, without admitting any liability, SIA Cargo entered into a settlement with the shipper, thereby resolving the claim against SIA Cargo.\nIn September 2016, one of SIA Cargo\u0092s customers filed a claim against SIA Cargo and the Company in the United States after opting out of SIA Cargo\u0092s and the Company\u0092s class action settlement.\nIn June 2017, without admitting any liability, SIA Cargo and the Company entered into a settlement of the above civil damages claim in the United States. At the same time, SIA Cargo and the Company settled the civil damages lawsuit filed in Germany, which was related to the opt-out claim in the United States.\nIn December 2018, without admitting any liability, SIA Cargo and the Company entered into a settlement with four out of the five claimant groups in the civil damages claim filed in England. In January 2019, the main defendant in the fifth claimant group proceedings discontinued its contribution claim against SIA Cargo and the Company. The entire civil damages claim filed in England has thus been resolved for SIA Cargo and the Company.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the Financial Year ended 31 March 2023\n39 Contingent Liabilities (in $ million) (continued)\n(a) Cargo: Investigations by Competition Authorities and Civil Class Actions (continued)\nWithout admitting any liability, SIA Cargo and the Company have settled with class and collective action plaintiffs in the United States, Australia, Canada and England, as the case may be, to resolve all liabilities of SIA Cargo and the Company as concerns such lawsuits filed in the relevant jurisdictions.\nIn addition, without admitting any liability, in 2012, 2013 and 2015, SIA Cargo reached settlements with certain customers to resolve all pending and potential future civil damage claims regarding the air cargo issues for those customers. The settlements in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017 have been reflected in the Group\u0092s financial statements in the previous financial years. The individual terms of all such settlements are required to be kept confidential.\nApart from the class actions in Canada, the United States and Australia, the opt-out claim in the United States, the lawsuit in Germany and the civil damages claims in England and South Korea, the filed cases remain in their respective procedural stages and none have been tried thus far on their respective substantive legal merits.\nApart from the items recorded as non-operating items noted above, it is premature to make a provision in the financial statements for the other pending investigations, court proceedings, civil suits, or threatened claims as their respective outcomes are uncertain.\n(b) Passengers: Civil Class Actions\nThe Company and several other airlines have been named in a civil class action lawsuit in Canada alleging an unlawful agreement to fix surcharges and fares on transpacific flights. The case is currently in the procedural stage and has not been tried thus far on its substantive legal merits. As the lawsuit has neither been tried nor alleged damages quantified, it is premature to make a provision in the financial statements.\nThe passenger civil class action lawsuit filed in the United States against the Company was resolved in a previous financial period.\n40 Financial Instruments (in $ million)\nClassification and fair values of financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are measured on an ongoing basis either at fair value or at amortised cost. The principal accounting policies in note 2 describe how the classes of financial instruments are measured, and how revenue and expenses, including fair value gains and losses, are recognised. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy are as per the following tables.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities that are classified as measured at amortised cost with carrying amounts being a reasonable approximation of their fair values are not presented in these tables. These financial assets include trade debtors, deposits and other debtors, amounts owing by subsidiary companies and cash and bank balances.

The factors above are considered collectively in determining the classification of property.\nImpairment assessment\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023, the Group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of its serviced apartment units. The review led to the reversal of an impairment loss of $5,006,000 (2022: $13,358,000) in view of the improvements in operating environment. The recoverable amount as at March 31, 2023 of $208,100,000 (2022: $207,300,000) was estimated using the fair value less costs to sell approach based on the discounted cash flow method as adopted by an external independent professional valuer engaged by the Group. The reversal of impairment loss is included in other operating income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the hospitality segment (Note 28).\nThe fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.\nJudgement is involved in the impairment assessment, including determining the key assumptions applied in arriving at the recoverable amount.

These relate to audit adjustments made after the full year results announcement on 29 June 2023.\nFor FY2023, the external auditors made certain qualifications and emphasis of matters in the auditors\u2019 report, and the qualifications and emphasis of matters were announced on the SGXNET on 14 September 2023.\nB.

However, they are committed to strengthening internal controls on a continuing basis.\nFor FY2023, the AC reviewed the adequacy and e\ufb00ectiveness of the Group\u2019s risk management systems as well as the internal control systems including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls based on procedures established and maintained by the Group and reviewed by the Management.

Independence of External Auditor\nThe Group\u2019s external auditor, Baker Tilly TFW, is an accounting firm registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. The external auditor was first appointed on by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 28 February 2018.

Based on expectations at the end of the reporting period, the Company considers that it is more likely than not that no amount will be payable under the arrangement.\nThe Group computes expected credit loss for financial guarantees using the probability of default approach. In determining ECL for financial guarantees, the Group consider events such as breach of loan covenants, default on instalment payments and determined that significant increase in credit risk occur when there is changes in the risk that the specified debtor will default on the contract.\n", "\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n36. Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont\u2019d)\n(c) Credit risk (cont\u2019d)\nExcessive risk concentration\nConcentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.\nIn order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Group\u2019s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly. The Group does not apply hedge accounting.\nExposure to credit risk\nThe Group and Company have no concentration of credit risk other than the amounts due from subsidiaries as disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements. The credit risk on bank balances is limited because the counterparties are reputable financial institutions.\nThe carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, grossed up for any allowances for losses, and the exposure to defaults from financial guarantees above, represents the Group\u2019s and Company\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.\nFurther details of credit risk on trade and other receivables are disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements.\nCredit risk concentration profile\nThe Group determines concentrations of credit risk by monitoring the country and industry sector profile of its trade receivables on an ongoing basis.

The ability of the Group and Company to pay its debts as and when they fall due are dependent on the factors as detailed in Note 2.1 under the header, Going Concern Assumption. The Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of stand-by credit facilities.\nAt the end of the reporting period, approximately 95% (2022: 83%) of the Group\u2019s loans and borrowings will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements.\nThe Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. Access to sources of funding is sufficiently available and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders.\nAnalysis of financial instruments by remaining contractual maturities\nThe table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s financial assets used for managing liquidity risk and financial liabilities at the end of the reporting period based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.\n\n |  | Group | \n | On demand   or within one | Within two   to   After five | \n | year | five years   years | Total\n31 March 2023 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000   $\u2019000 | $\u2019000\nFinancial assets:\n\nTrade and other receivables | 1,538 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 1,538\nOther current assets, excluding prepayments | 190 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 190\nCash and bank balances | 14,376 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 14,376\nTotal undiscounted financial assets | 16,104 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 16,104\nFinancial liabilities: Trade and other payables, excluding non-refundable\n\ndeposits | 11,426 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 11,426\nBank borrowings (secured) | 86,977 | 5,493 | \u2013 | 92,470\nFinance leases | 39 | 3 | \u2013 | 42\nLoan from a non-controlling interest | 12,408 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 12,408\nTotal undiscounted financial liabilities | 110,850 | 5,496 | \u2013 | 116,346\nTotal net undiscounted financial liabilities | (94,746) | (5,496) | \u2013 | (100,242)\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230714OTHRXUIE_Kop Limited_20230714202221_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [9, 12]}, {"question": "What is the net carrying value of the investment in associate as of 28 February 2023?", "answer": "The net carrying value of the investment in associate as of 28 February 2023 is RM-.", "raw_text": "What is the net carrying value of the investment in associate as of 28 February 2023?\n###ANSWER:\nThe net carrying value of the investment in associate as of 28 February 2023 is RM-.", "pages": ["NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2023\n15.

Measurement of progress is determined based on the proportion of contract costs incurred to date to the estimated total contact costs.\nRevenue from Engineering & Construction contracts are also adjusted with variations to the contracts claimable from customers, as well as liquidated damages due to delays or other causes, payable to customers.\nWe focus on this area because of the significant management\u2019s judgements that are required to estimate:\n\n-\nthe amount of variation orders that are highly likely to be approved by the customers, and included in the total contract sum;\n\n-   the total contract costs, including variation claims   from sub-contractors, which affected the measurement   of progress of the projects at the reporting date and   accordingly revenue recognised; and\n-\nprovision for liquidated damage from these contracts.\nHow our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\nWe have performed the following audit procedures to address the Key Audit Matter:\nWe have obtained an understanding of the progress of projects through discussions with management and examination of documents such as contracts and correspondences with customers, variation claims from sub-contractors and advice from external legal advisers.\nIn relation to total contract revenue, our audit procedures include the following:\n\na.   Traced the total contract sums to contracts and   agreed variation orders;\nb.\nFor variation orders where management had determined that there was sufficient basis to claim from customers but pending final agreement with the customers, selected samples of claims to customers\u2019 instructions and schedule of rates with subcontractors or quotations from subcontractors; and\n\nc.\nAssessed the progress of construction against contractual timeline for delays and the adequacy of provision for liquidated damages.\nIn relation to total contract costs, our audit procedures include the following:\n\na.   Selected samples of costs incurred and traced to   supplier invoices and sub-contractors\u2019 billings; and\nb.\nSelected samples of projects in progress at the reporting date and tested estimation of cost-to-complete by tracing to quotations and/or contracts with sub-contractors and suppliers.\nIn relation to the revenue recognised for projects in progress at the reporting date, we have:\n\na.   Recomputed the measurement of progress based on   the proportion of contract costs incurred to-date to   the estimated total contract costs; and\nb.\nRecomputed the revenue for the current financial year based on the measurement of progress and traced to the accounting records.\nBased on the audit procedures performed, we have assessed management\u2019s estimation of the revenue on Engineering & Construction contracts to be reasonable.\nWe have assessed that the disclosures in the financial statements in relation to the sensitivity of estimations on revenue and costs on Engineering & Construction contracts to be appropriate.\n", "Independent Auditor\u2019s Report\nTO THE MEMBERS OF BOUSTEAD PROJECTS LIMITED\nOther Information\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the sections of the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThe directors\u2019 responsibilities include overseeing the Group\u2019s financial reporting process.\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n\u2022\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n\u2022\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.\n\n\u2022\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\n\u2022\nConclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n", "Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nIndependent Auditor\u2019s Report\nTO THE MEMBERS OF BOUSTEAD PROJECTS LIMITED\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont\u2019d)\n\n\u2022\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n\u2022\nObtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

The effectiveness of hedging is evaluated based upon the correlation between cumulative change in the fair value or cash flow of the hedging instrument and that of the hedged item. Hedges exempted from being marked-to-market under the two accounting treatments described in the first paragraph are judged to pass the effectiveness tests of hedging with their eligibility of applying those treatments.\n(3) Group Tax Sharing System\nThe Group Tax Sharing System has been adopted.\n(Changes in accounting policies)\n(Application of Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement)\nThe Company has applied the \u201cImplementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement\u201d (ASBJ Guidance No. 31, June 17, 2021) from the beginning of the current fiscal year, and prospectively applied the new accounting policy provided for by the Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement in accordance with the transitional treatment prescribed in Paragraph 27-2 of the Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement.

As at the date of this report, the Board has three female Directors, representing 60% of the total Board membership.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nHaving considered the scope and nature of the operations of the Group, the Board is satisfied that the current size and composition of the Board and Board Committees are appropriate and reflective of the Company\u2019s commitment to Board diversity with a good balance of skills, experience, industry knowledge, professional qualifications, gender and age, which serve to support the Group in achieving its strategic objectives.\nThe Company will continue to maintain the appropriate balance of perspectives, skills and experience on the Board to support the long- term success of the Group in line with the Board Diversity Policy.\nProvision 2.5 Meeting of Non-Executive Directors\nThe Board has four non-executive Directors (including the independent Directors) who endeavour to constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and to review the performance of the Management in meeting agreed-upon goals and objectives, and monitor the reporting of performance. The Directors also review and oversee effective implementation by the Management in achieving agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance.\nDuring the year, the non-executive Directors communicated among themselves without the presence of the Management as and when the occasion warrants, and the chairperson of such meetings provides feedback to the Board and/or Chairman as appropriate. The Company also co-ordinates informal sessions for non-executive Directors to meet on a need-basis without the presence of the Management.\nROLE OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nPrinciple 3: Clear Division of Responsibilities between the Board and Management and Balance of Power and Authority\nProvision 3.1 Common Role of Chairman and CEO\nMr Takahashi Kenichi is both the chairman of the Board (\u201cChairman\u201d) and the chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of the Company. The Board is of the view that it is not necessary to separate the role of the Chairman and the CEO after taking into consideration the size, scope and the nature of the operations of the Group. Mr Takahashi Kenichi is the founder of the Group and has played an instrumental role in developing the business since its establishment. He has considerable industry experience and business network and has also provided the Group with strong leadership and vision. The Board is of the view that it is in the interest of the Group to adopt a single leadership structure.\nMr Wong Hin Sun, Eugene is the Vice Chairman and Non-Executive Director of the Company and supports Mr Takahashi Kenichi in his Chairman role.\nThe Board is of the view that with the three Board Committees and the Vice Chairman, there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent an uneven concentration of power and authority in a single individual.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nProvision 3.2 Roles and Responsibilities of Chairman\nThe Board has established and set out in writing the division of responsibilities between the roles of Chairman and the roles of CEO notwithstanding that these roles are assumed by the same person.\nThe Chairman seeks to, amongst others:\n(a) lead the Board to ensure its effectiveness on all aspects of its role; (b)\nset the agenda and ensure that adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items, in particular strategic issues; (c)\nensure that the Directors receive complete, accurate, timely and clear information; (d)\nensure effective communication with Shareholders; (e)\nencourage constructive relations within the Board and between the Board and the Management; (f)\npromote a culture of openness and debate at the Board; (g)\nfacilitate the effective contribution of non-executive Directors; and (h)\npromote high standards of corporate governance.\nThe responsibilities of the CEO are set out in a service agreement entered into between the Company and the CEO.

Mdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance who is the Chairperson of the ARC is also the Lead Independent Director of the Company. The Board is of the view that there are sufficient safeguards and checks in place to ensure that the process of decision-making by the Directors is independent and based on collective decision-making without the Chairman and CEO being able to exercise considerable concentration of power or influence.\nAs the Lead Independent Director of the Company, Mdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance acts as the leader of the Independent Directors at Board Meetings to provide non-executive perspectives and contribute a balance of viewpoints on the Board. She is also available to Shareholders if they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of the Chairman, the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) has failed to resolve their concerns or is inappropriate.\nThe independent Directors, led by the Lead Independent Director, meet amongst themselves without the presence of the other Directors where necessary, and the Lead Independent Director will provide feedback to the Chairman after such meetings.\nBOARD MEMBERSHIP\nPrinciple 4: Formal and Transparent Process for the Appointment of Directors to the Board\n\nProvision 4.1 and Provision 4.2\nMembership and Roles and Responsibilities of the NC\nThe Board establishes a NC to make recommendations to the Board on relevant matters, pertaining to the composition of the Board including aspects such as professional qualifications of its Directors, industry and geographic knowledge, experience, skills, length of service and the needs of the Company.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHR4OFY_Japan Foods Holding Ltd._20230705065716_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [63, 66]}, {"question": "What is the maximum amount that the Company could be forced to settle under the corporate guarantee obligations if the full guaranteed amount is claimed by the counterparties to the guarantees?", "answer": "$8.1 million", "raw_text": "What is the maximum amount that the Company could be forced to settle under the corporate guarantee obligations if the full guaranteed amount is claimed by the counterparties to the guarantees?\n###ANSWER:\n$8.1 million", "pages": ["\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n30.

The Group and the Company are also required by the banks to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of not exceeding 150% (2022: 150%). The gearing ratio is defined as ratio of total bank borrowings against total net worth.

In particular, the Company will not have the right to attend or vote at meetings and for the purposes of the Companies Act, the Company shall be treated as having no right to vote and the treasury shares shall be treated as having no voting rights.\nIn addition, no dividend may be paid, and no other distribution (whether in cash or otherwise) of the Company\u2019s assets may be made, to the Company in respect of the treasury shares. However, the allotment of shares as fully paid bonus shares in respect of the treasury shares is allowed. Also, a subdivision or consolidation of any treasury share into treasury shares of a greater or smaller number is allowed, so long as the total value of the treasury shares after the subdivision or consolidation is the same as before.\n(iii) Disposal and Cancellation\nWhere Shares are held as treasury shares, the Company may at any time (but subject always to the Take- over Code):\n\n(aa) | sell the treasury shares for cash;\n(ab) | transfer the treasury shares for the purposes of or pursuant to any share scheme, whether for   employees, directors or other persons;\n(ac) | transfer the treasury shares as consideration for the acquisition of shares in or assets of another   company or assets of a person;\n(ad) | cancel the treasury shares; or\n(ae) sell, transfer or otherwise use the treasury shares for such other purposes as may be prescribed by the Minister for Finance.\nUnder Rule 704(31) of the Catalist Rules, an immediate announcement must be made of any sale, transfer, cancellation and/or use of treasury shares (in each case, the \u201cusage\u201d). Such announcement must include details such as the date of the usage, the purpose of the usage, the number of treasury shares comprised in the usage, the number of treasury shares before and after the usage, the percentage of the number of treasury shares comprised in the usage against the total number of issued shares (of the same class as the treasury shares) which are listed on the Catalist before and after the usage, and the value of the treasury shares if they are used for a sale or transfer or cancelled.\n6. Source of Funds\nThe Companies Act permits the Company to purchase or acquire its Shares out of capital or distributable profits so long as the Company is solvent. For this purpose, the Company is solvent if at the date of payment for the Shares purchased or acquired, the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a) there is no ground on which the Company could be found to be unable to pay its debts;\n(b) if:\n\n(i)\nit is intended to commence winding up of the Company within the period of 12 months immediately after the date of the payment, the Company will be able to pay its debts in full within the period of 12 months after the date of commencement of the winding up; or\n(ii) it is not intended so to commence winding up, the Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due during the period of 12 months immediately after the date of the payment; and\n(c) the value of the Company\u2019s assets is not less than the value of its liabilities (including) contingent liabilities)\nand will not, after the purchase or acquisition of Shares, become less than the value of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities).\nThe Company intends to use internal sources of funds or external borrowings, or a combination of internal resources and external borrowings, to finance the purchase or acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate. However, in considering the option of external borrowing, the Directors will consider particularly the prevailing gearing level of the Company and the costs of such financing.\n", "APPENDIX\n7. Financial Effects\nIt is not possible for the Company to realistically calculate or quantify the impact of purchases that may be made pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate on the net tangible asset value or earnings per Share as the resultant effect would depend on factors such as the aggregate numbers of Shares purchased, the purchase prices paid at the relevant times, whether the Shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or immediately cancelled on purchase or acquisition, how the Shares held in treasury are subsequently dealt with by the Company in accordance with Section 76K of the Companies Act, and the amounts (if any) borrowed by the Company to fund the purchases.\nWhere the purchase of Shares is made out of distributable profits, such purchase (including costs incidental to the purchase) will correspondingly reduce the amount available for the distribution of cash dividends by the Company. Where the purchase of Shares is made out of capital, the amount available for the distribution of cash dividends by the Company will not be reduced.\nWhere the purchase of Shares is financed through internal resources, it will reduce the cash reserves of the Group and the Company, and thus the current assets and shareholders\u2019 funds of the Group and the Company. This will result in an increase in the gearing ratios of the Group and the Company and a decline in the current ratios of the Group and the Company. The actual impact on the gearing and current ratios will depend on the number of Shares purchased or acquired and the prices at which the Shares are purchased or acquired.\nWhere the purchase or acquisition of Shares is financed through external borrowings or financing, there would be an increase in the gearing ratios of the Group and the Company, and a decline in the current ratios and shareholders\u2019 funds of the Group and the Company, with the actual impact dependent on the number of Shares purchased or acquired and the prices at which the Shares are purchased or acquired.\nFor illustrative purposes only and on the basis of the following assumptions:\n(a) that the purchase or acquisition by the Company of Shares was made on 1 April 2022\n(b) that (i) in the case of the purchase or acquisition of Shares made entirely out of capital, the Company purchased or acquired 16,728,239 Shares, representing 5% of its issued Shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) as at 31 March 2023, and (ii) in the case of the purchase or acquisition of Shares made entirely out of profits, the Company purchased or acquired 1,672,823 Shares, representing 0.50% of its issued Shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) as at 31 March 2023;\n(c) that (i) in the case of Market Purchases, the Company purchased or acquired Shares at the Maximum Price of S$0.16464 for each Share (being 105% of the Average Closing Price of the Shares for the five Market Days on which transactions in the Shares were recorded immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date), and (ii) in the case of Off-Market Purchases, the Company purchased or acquired Shares at the Maximum Price of S$0.18816 for each Share (being 120% of the Average Closing Price of the Shares for the five Market Days on which transactions in the Shares were recorded immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date)\n(d) that the purchase or acquisition of Shares by the Company was financed entirely using its internal sources of funds and required funds amounting to:\n(i) in the case of Market Purchases made entirely out of capital, S$2,754,137.27 (equivalent to RM9,529,314.95);\n(ii) in the case of Off-Market Purchases made entirely out of capital, S$3,147,585.45 (equivalent to RM10,890,645.66);\n\n(iii) | in the case of Market Purchases made entirely out of profits, S$275,413.58   RM952,930.98); and | (equivalent to\n(iv) | in the case of Off-Market Purchases made entirely out of profits, S$314,758.38   RM1,089,063.98). | (equivalent to\n(e) the transaction costs incurred for the purchase or acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate are insignificant and have not been taken into account in computing the financial effects.

In relation to Ordinary Resolution Nos. 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c), Mr Goh Choon Phong will, upon re-election, continue to serve as a member of the Board Executive Committee and the Customer Experience, Technology and Sustainability Committee. Mr Dominic Ho Chiu Fai will, upon re-election, continue to serve as Chairman of the Board Safety and Risk Committee and a member of the Board Audit Committee. Mr Lee Kim Shin will, upon re-election, continue to serve as a member of the Board Nominating Committee and the Board Safety and Risk Committee. Mr Ho and Mr Lee are considered independent Directors. Mr Goh, who is the Chief Executive Officer, is considered a non-independent Director. Please refer to the section on Additional Information on Directors Seeking Re-Election in the Annual Report FY2022/23 for information relating to each of these Directors, as set out in Appendix 7.4.1 of the Listing Manual of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the \u0093SGX-ST\u0094).\n2. Ordinary Resolution No. 4, if passed, will facilitate the payment of up to S$2,600,000 as Directors\u0092 fees during the financial year in which the fees are incurred, that is, during the financial year ending 31 March 2024 (\u0093FY2023/24\u0094) (up to S$2,000,000 for the previous financial year). The proposed increase of up to S$600,000 for FY2023/24 is mainly due to the cessation of the 30% reduction in Directors\u0092 fees. Soon after the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the Board had voluntarily reduced their fees by 30%, as a show of solidarity with Management\u0092s salary reductions. With the Company\u0092s recovery from the pandemic, all such reductions have ceased. The proposed Directors\u0092 fees for FY2023/24 are consequently higher than for the previous financial year. Directors\u0092 fees are computed based on the anticipated number of Board and Board Committee meetings for FY2023/24, assuming full attendance in person by all of the non-executive Directors. The amount also caters for any additional unscheduled Board or Board Committee meetings and/or the formation of additional Board Committees. The amount also includes transport and travel benefits to be provided to the non-executive Directors. In the event that the amount proposed is insufficient, approval will be sought at the next Annual General Meeting in year 2024 (\u00932024 AGM\u0094) before payments are made to Directors for the shortfall. Mr Goh Choon Phong, being the Chief Executive Officer, does not receive any Director\u0092s fees.\nThe current intention is that the Directors\u0092 fees for non-executive Directors for FY2023/24 will comprise a cash component and a share component, with approximately 30% being paid out in the form of awards under the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014. Any such award would typically consist of the grant of fully paid shares outright with no performance or vesting conditions attached, but with a selling moratorium of one year. Non-executive Directors would eventually be required to hold shares (including shares obtained by other means) worth a minimum of the annual basic retainer fees (currently S$90,000) as the shares paid out to them as part of their remuneration in lieu of cash accumulate over time.\nThe cash component of the Directors\u0092 fees for FY2023/24 is intended to be paid quarterly in arrears. The share component of the Directors\u0092 fees for FY2023/24 is intended to be paid after the 2024 AGM has been held. The actual number of shares to be awarded to each non- executive Director holding office at the time of the payment is intended to be determined by reference to the volume weighted average price of a share on the SGX-ST over the 10 trading days from (and including) the day on which the shares are first quoted ex-dividend after the 2024 AGM (or, if no final dividend is proposed at the 2024 AGM, or the resolution to approve any such final dividend is not approved at the 2024 AGM, over the 10 trading days immediately following the date of the 2024 AGM). The number of shares to be awarded will be rounded down to the nearest hundred and any residual balance will be settled in cash. A non-executive Director who steps down before the payment of the share component will receive all of his Directors\u0092 fees for FY2023/24 (calculated on a pro-rated basis, where applicable) in cash.\n3. Ordinary Resolution No. 6, if passed, will empower the Directors to issue shares, make or grant instruments convertible into shares and to issue shares pursuant to such instruments. The number of shares which the Directors may issue under this Ordinary Resolution will not exceed 50% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings), with a sub-limit of 5% for issues other than on a pro rata basis. The 5% sub-limit for non-pro rata issues is lower than the 20% sub-limit allowed under the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST. For the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares which may be issued, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) at the time this Ordinary Resolution is passed, after adjusting for (a) new shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible instruments or share options or vesting of share awards which were issued and are outstanding at the time this Ordinary Resolution is passed; and (b) any subsequent bonus issue or consolidation or subdivision of shares. For the avoidance of doubt, shareholders\u0092 approval will be required for any consolidation or subdivision of shares. As at 5 June 2023, the Company had 6,967,078 treasury shares and no subsidiary holdings.\n4. Ordinary Resolution No. 7, if passed, will empower the Directors to grant awards pursuant to the SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 and the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014, and to allot and issue ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to the SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 and the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014.\nThe SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 and the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 were adopted at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 30 July 2014. At the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018, shareholders approved alterations to the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 to enable non-executive Directors of the Company and/or its subsidiaries to participate in the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 (in addition to employees, including executive Directors of the Company and/or its subsidiaries).\nThe total number of ordinary shares which may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 and the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 (whether in the form of ordinary shares or in the form of cash in lieu of ordinary shares) shall not exceed 5% of the total number of issued ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time. In addition, Ordinary Resolution No. 7 will also provide that the total number of ordinary shares under awards to be granted pursuant to the SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 and the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 from this Annual General Meeting to the next Annual General Meeting (the \u0093Relevant Year\u0094) shall not exceed 0.5% of the total number of issued ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time (the \u0093Yearly Limit\u0094), provided that if the Yearly Limit is not fully utilised during the Relevant Year, any unutilised portion of the Yearly Limit may be used by the Directors to make grants of awards under the SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 and the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 in subsequent years, for the duration of the SIA Performance Share Plan 2014 and the SIA Restricted Share Plan 2014 respectively.\n5. Ordinary Resolution No. 8, if passed, will renew the mandate to allow the Company, its subsidiaries and associated companies that are entities at risk (as that term is used in Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST) or any of them, to enter into certain interested person transactions with certain classes of interested persons as described in the Appendix to the Letter to Shareholders dated 28 June 2023 (the \u0093Letter\u0094). The authority will, unless revoked or varied by the Company in general meeting, continue in force until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.

The Group has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for property leases; instead, these are accounted for as one single lease component.\nLease liabilities are measured at amortised cost, and are remeasured when:\n\u2022 There is a change in future lease payments arising from changes in an index or rate;\n\u2022 There is a change in the Group\u2019s assessment of whether it will exercise lease extension and termination options;\n\u2022 There is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or\n\u2022 There is a modification to the lease term.\nWhen lease liabilities are remeasured, corresponding adjustments are made against the right-of-use assets. If the carrying amounts of the right-of-use assets have been reduced to zero, the adjustments are recorded in profit or loss. The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of 12 months or less, as well as leases of low value assets, except in the case of sub-lease arrangements. Lease payments relating to these leases are expensed to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nVariable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate are included in the measurement of the corresponding right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Other variable lease payments are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.\nShort-term lease and lease of low-value assets\nThe Group applies the short-term leases recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be low value. Lease payment on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n(v) Segment Reporting\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the executive personnel whose members are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.\n(w) Related Parties\nA related party is defined as follows:\nA related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements (referred to as the \u201creporting entity\u201d).\na. A person or a close member of that person\u2019s family is related to a reporting entity if that person:\ni. has control or joint control over the reporting entity;\nii. has significant influence over the reporting entity; or\niii. is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n2 Significant Accounting Policies (cont\u2019d)\n(w) Related Parties (cont\u2019d)\nb.

The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns.\nThe provision matrix is initially based on the Group\u2019s historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, historical default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECL is a significant estimate. The amount of ECL is sensitive to changes in circumstances. The forecast economic conditions and the Group\u2019s historical credit loss experience may also not be representative of the customer\u2019s actual default in the future. The information about the ECL on the Group\u2019s trade receivables are disclosed in Note 32(a)(iv) to the financial statements.\n(b) Inventories written-down\nAs at 31 March 2023, the carrying amount of inventory is S$659,000 (2022: S$19,017,000).

The key risks include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group reviews and agrees policies and procedures for the management of these risks.\nThere has been no change to the Group\u2019s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks.\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from its loans and borrowings. The Group\u2019s loans and borrowings are predominantly denominated in floating rates and are expected to be repriced at intervals of less than one year from the financial year end. At present, the Group\u2019s policy is to obtain the most favourable interest rate arrangements available.\nAs at the end of the reporting period, if the interest of the floating rate loans and borrowings had been 100 (2022: 100) basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the Group\u2019s profit net of tax would have been $658,000 (2022: $785,000) lower/higher, arising mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate loans and borrowings.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230703OTHRGM84_The Hour Glass Limited_20230703172452_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [18, 21]}, {"question": "Who is the largest shareholder of Hs Optimus Holdings Limited as of 27 June 2023?", "answer": "Lee Han Peng", "raw_text": "Who is the largest shareholder of Hs Optimus Holdings Limited as of 27 June 2023?\n###ANSWER:\nLee Han Peng", "pages": ["\nSTATISTICS OF\n\nSHAREHOLDINGS\nAs at 27 June 2023\n\nNumber of shares\nClass of shares\nVoting rights\nNumber of shares held in treasury\nNumber of subsidiary holdings\n: 5,380,556,316 ordinary shares one vote per share Nil : :\n:\n: Nil\nBased on information available to the Company as at 27 June 2023, approximately 77% of the total issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) of the Company is held by the public and, therefore, Rule 723 of the Catalist Rules issued by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited is complied with.\n\nSIZE OF SHAREHOLDINGS | NO.

All other subsequent expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.\nWhen an investment property is disposed of, the resulting gain or loss recognised in the statement of total return is the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the property.\nInvestment properties are not depreciated. The properties are subject to continued maintenance and regularly revalued on the basis set out above.\n3.4 Investment property held for sale\nInvestment property that is highly probable to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, is classified as an investment property held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the investment property is remeasured in accordance with the Group\u2019s accounting policies. Thereafter, the investment property classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\nUpon disposal, the resulting gain or loss recognised in the statement of total return is the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the investment property.\n3.5 Financial instruments (i)\nRecognition and initial measurement\n\t\t Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities\nTrade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, or minus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (\u201cFVTPL\u201d), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n", "\n\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended 31 March 2023\n3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d) 3.5\nFinancial instruments (cont\u2019d) (ii)\nClassification and subsequent measurement\n\t\t Non-derivative financial assets\nOn initial recognition, the Group classifies its non-derivative financial assets as measured at amortised cost.\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n\u2022\nit is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\n\u2022\nits contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\t\t Non-derivative financial assets: Business model assessment\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to the Manager. The information considered includes:\n\n\u2022\nhow the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Manager; and the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed.\n\n\u2022\nTransfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group\u2019s continuing recognition of the assets.\n\nNon-derivative financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments\nof principal and interest\nFor the purposes of this assessment, \u2018principal\u2019 is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. \u2018Interest\u2019 is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:\n\n\u2022\ncontingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features; prepayment and extension features; and terms that limit the Group\u2019s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n", "\n\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended 31 March 2023\n3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d) 3.5\nFinancial instruments (cont\u2019d) (ii)\nClassification and subsequent measurement (cont\u2019d)\n\nNon-derivative financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments\nof principal and interest (cont\u2019d)\nA prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.\n\t\t Non-derivative financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in the statement of total return. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the statement of total return.\n\t\t Non-derivative financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost.\nFinancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total return. These financial liabilities comprised interest-bearing borrowings, trade and other payables (excluding rental received in advance), lease liabilities and liabilities directly associated with the investment property held for sale.\n(iii) Derecognition\n\t\tFinancial assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\nThe Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.\n\t\tFinancial liabilities\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the statement of total return.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230622OTHRHMBI_Aims Apac Reit Management Limited_20230622071630_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf",

THE SHARE PURCHASE MANDATE\n2.1 Background\nThe Companies Act allows a Singapore-incorporated company to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued ordinary shares, stocks and preference shares if the purchase or acquisition is permitted under the company\u2019s constitution. Any purchase or acquisition of Shares by the Company would have to be made in accordance with, and in the manner prescribed by, the Companies Act, the Catalist Rules and such other laws and regulations as may for the time being be applicable. As the Company is listed on Catalist, it is also required to comply with Part XI of Chapter 8 of the Catalist Rules, which relates to the purchase or acquisition by an issuer of its own shares.\nRegulation 20 expressly permits the Company to purchase its issued Shares. However, any Share which is purchased or acquired by the Company shall, unless held as treasury shares to the extent permitted under the Companies Act, be deemed cancelled immediately on purchase or acquisition.\nIt is a requirement under the Companies Act and the Catalist Rules that a company which wishes to purchase or otherwise acquire its own shares should obtain the prior specific approval of its shareholders to do so at a general meeting.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230714OTHRXUIE_Kop Limited_20230714202221_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [27, 30]}, {"question": "Who is the Chief Executive Officer of Mpact Management Ltd.?", "answer": "Ms Sharon Lim", "raw_text": "Who is the Chief Executive Officer of Mpact Management Ltd.?\n###ANSWER: Ms Sharon Lim", "pages": ["CORPORATE DIRECTORY\nManager\nMPACT Management Ltd.\nRegistered Office\n10 Pasir Panjang Road #13-01 Mapletree Business City Singapore 117438\nT: +65 6377 6111 F: +65 6274 3185 W: www.mapletreepact.com E: mpact@mapletree.com.sg\nBoard of Directors\nMr Samuel Tsien\n\nNon-Executive Chairman\nand Director\nMs Tan Su Shan\n\nLead Independent\nNon-Executive Director\nMr Premod Thomas\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMs Lilian Chiang\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMr Kan Shik Lum\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMr Chua Kim Chiu\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMr Lawrence Wong\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMr Wu Long Peng\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMr Pascal Lambert\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMr Mak Keat Meng\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMr Alvin Tay\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\nMr Chua Tiow Chye\nNon-Executive Director\nMs Wendy Koh\nNon-Executive Director\nMs Sharon Lim\n\nExecutive Director and\nChief Executive Officer\n\nNominating and\nRemuneration Committee\nMs Tan Su Shan\nChairperson\nMs Lilian Chiang\nMr Kan Shik Lum\nMr Chua Tiow Chye\nAudit and Risk Committee\nMr Premod Thomas\nChairman\nMr Chua Kim Chiu\nMr Lawrence Wong\nMr Wu Long Peng\nManagement\nMs Sharon Lim\nChief Executive Officer\nMs Janica Tan\nChief Financial Officer\nMr Chow Mun Leong\n\nCo-Head, Investments &\nAsset Management\nMr Koh Wee Leong\n\nCo-Head, Investments &\nAsset Management\nCorporate Services\nMr Wan Kwong Weng\nJoint Company Secretary\nMs See Hui Hui\nJoint Company Secretary\nUnit Registrar\nBoardroom Corporate & Advisory Services Pte.

It also requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3.\nInterpretations and amendments to published standards effective in 2022\nOn 1 April 2022, the Group has adopted the new or amended SFRS(I) and Interpretations of SFRS(I) (\u201cINT SFRS(I)\u201d) that are mandatory for application for the financial year. Changes to the Group\u2019s accounting policies have been made as required, in accordance with the transitional provisions in the respective SFRS(I) and INT SFRS(I).\nThe adoption of these new or amended SFRS(I) and INT SFRS(I) did not result in substantial changes to the Group\u2019s accounting policies and had no material effect on the amounts reported for the current or prior financial years.\n2.2 Revenue recognition\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\nRevenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised goods or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the goods or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time.

Customers membership points earned through qualified purchases are considered as a separate performance obligation arising from transactions with customers.\nThe Group estimates the value of the future redemption obligation based on the estimated value of the products for which the membership points are expected to be redeemed based on historical redemption patterns, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will not be redeemed.\n(c) Sales of food ingredients\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the satisfaction of each performance obligation which is represented by the delivery of goods to customers. Each fulfilled order comprises of a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time.\nSale of materials represents the invoiced value of raw materials and sundry consumables, net of discounts and goods and services tax.\n(d) Franchise income\nUpfront franchise fees are recognised over time throughout the license period as the franchisee simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from the Group\u2019s performance of providing access to its license.\nRecurring franchise income is recognised on a pre-determined amount in accordance with terms as stated in the franchise agreements.\n(e) Royalty income\nRoyalty income is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits over the duration of the royalty agreement.\nRoyalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.\n(f) Interest income\nInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method.\n", "NOTES TO TH E\nFI NANCIAL STATEM EN TS\nFor the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2023\n2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n2.3 Government grants\nGrants from the government are recognised as a receivable at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all the attached conditions.\nGovernment grants receivable are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government grants relating to expenses are shown separately as other income.\nGovernment grants relating to assets are deducted against the carrying amount of the assets.\n2.4 Group accounting\n(a) Subsidiary corporations\n(i) Consolidation\nSubsidiary corporations are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control.

Subsidiary corporations are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date on that control ceases.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group entities are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment indicator of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiary corporations have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n(ii) Acquisitions\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations entered into by the Group.\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary corporation or business comprises the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.

The Board is assisted by the Nominating Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Audit & Risk Committee, each of which has its own terms of reference that set out the authority and duties of each of the Board Committees.\nA description of, among others, the composition and the terms of reference, and a summary of the activities of the respective Board Committees during FY2023 are set out in the following sections:\n(a)\n\nin respect of the Nominating Committee \u2013 sections on Principle 4 under \u201cBoard Membership\u201d and Principle 5 under\n\u201cBoard Performance\u201d;\n(b)\n\nin respect of the Remuneration Committee \u2013 sections on Principle 6 under \u201cProcedures for Developing Remuneration\nPolicies\u201d and Principle 7 under \u201cLevel and Mix of Remuneration\u201d; and\n(c) in respect of the Audit & Risk Committee \u2013 sections on Principle 9 under \u201cRisk Management and Internal Controls\u201d and Principle 10 under \u201cAudit & Risk Committee\u201d.\nBoard Meetings\nThe Board meets at least once every quarter. The schedule for the forthcoming financial year is normally determined before the fourth quarter of each calendar year to allow the directors to plan for their attendance at these meetings. Where necessary, additional Board meetings will be held to address any significant transactions or issues that arise.\nBoard papers and related materials are sent to Board or Board Committee members in advance prior to each meeting to allow the Board or Board Committee members sufficient time to familiarise themselves with the matters prior to the meetings. Management and senior executives who can provide additional insights into the matters to be discussed are also invited to attend the meetings so as to be at hand to address any questions that the Board or Board Committee members may have.\nDuring the scheduled quarterly meetings, Management will provide the Board with an update on the Group\u2019s business and operations for the relevant quarter and the financial performance for that quarter, and any other significant matters or issues that may have arisen. This promotes active engagement with Management and allows the Board to have oversight and better understanding of the progress of the Group\u2019s business and operations as well as any issues and/or challenges encountered by the Group.\nUnless a director is required to recuse himself/herself from deliberations and abstain from voting on a matter due to an actual or a potential conflict of interest, all members of the Board or Board Committee will participate in the discussions and deliberations at Board or Board Committee meetings. To facilitate attendance and participation, a director who is not able to attend a Board or Board Committee meeting in person is permitted under the Company\u2019s Constitution to participate by way of telephone and video-conference.\nThe Board and Board Committees may also make decisions by way of resolutions in writing. In such situations, resolutions in writing, together with board papers and related materials, will be circulated to all members of the Board or Board Committee for their consideration and approval. Management will, where necessary, reach out to the directors to provide any explanation or other information as may be required for the directors to deliberate on the matter before approving such written resolutions.\nThe Board requires each director to be able to commit sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company. A discussion of the procedure for assessing the directors\u2019 commitment to the Company is set out in the section \u201cAssessment of Directors\u2019 Commitment\u201d of Principle 4 under \u201cBoard Membership\u201d.\nDuring FY2023, a total of four scheduled Board meetings, four scheduled Audit & Risk Committee meetings, one scheduled Nominating Committee meeting and one scheduled Remuneration Committee meeting were held. There were also four additional Board meetings, including verification meetings, held during FY2023. The Board and Audit & Risk Committee members also had several informal discussions on various issues relating to corporate strategy, risk management and specific significant matters during FY2023.\n", "Corporate Governance\nThe number of Board and Board Committee meetings held during FY2023 as well as the attendance of each director at these meetings are set out in the table below:\n\n |  | Board | Audit & Risk   Committee | Nominating   Committee | Remuneration   Committee\nName of Director | No.   Held | No.   Attended | No.   No.   Held   Attended | No.   No.   Held   Attended | No.   No.   Held   Attended\nJohn Lim Kok Min | 8 | 8 | 4   4 | 1   1 | 1   1\nWong Yu Wei (Huang Youwei) | 8 | 8 | -   - | 1   1 | -   -\nChu Kok Hong @ Choo Kok Hong | 8 | 7 | -   - | 1   - | -   -\nChong Lit Cheong | 8 | 8 | 4   4 | 1   1 | 1   1\nProfessor Yong Kwet Yew | 8 | 8 | 4   3* | 1   1 | 1   1\nTam Chee Chong | 8 | 8 | 4   4 | 1   1 | -   -\n* Professor Yong Kwet Yew was appointed as a member of the Audit & Risk Committee on 1 July 2022 and had attended all meetings of the Audit & Risk Committee held after the date of his appointment.\nAccess to Information\nManagement recognises that it is essential to provide the Board with complete and adequate information on Group affairs and material events and transactions on a timely and on-going basis in order for the directors to discharge their duties and responsibilities and to make decisions based on relevant and up-to-date information.\nManagement regularly provides the Board with management reports and updates relating to the Group\u2019s business and operations and financial information, including management accounts of the Group\u2019s performance, position and prospects on a quarterly basis. As set out above in the section \u201cBoard Meetings\u201d, board papers and related materials (including, where appropriate, relevant background or explanatory information, financial analysis and/or external reports) are provided to the Board or Board Committee in advance of the relevant Board or Board Committee meeting. Directors have unrestricted access to the Company\u2019s records and information and are entitled to request from Management additional information as needed to make informed decisions. The directors also have separate and independent access to Management as well as the company secretary.\nManagement and senior executives who can provide additional insights into the matters to be discussed will attend Board and Board Committee meetings to provide any other information as may be required by the Board or the relevant Board Committee, and to answer any queries from the directors. Management may also communicate with the directors outside of formal Board and Board Committee meetings through other means, such as electronic mail, telephone or video-conferencing, or separate physical meetings. Any requests by directors for further explanation, briefings or informal discussions on any aspect of the Group\u2019s operations are attended to expeditiously by Management.\nWhere the directors require independent professional advice to facilitate the discharge of their duties and responsibilities, Management will facilitate the appointment of such professional advisor to render advice to the Board. The cost of obtaining such professional advice will be borne by the Company.\nRole of Company Secretary\nThe company secretary attends all Board meetings and is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed. The company secretary ensures good information flow within the Board and the Board Committees and between Management and non-executive directors, advising the Board on all governance matters, as well as facilitating and assisting with professional development as required. The company secretary, together with other management staff, are responsible for ensuring that the Company complies with the applicable requirements, rules and regulations.\nThe appointment and the removal of the company secretary is subject to the approval of the Board.\n", "Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nCorporate Governance\nCommitment to Sustainability\nThe Board is committed to ensuring the Company\u2019s longevity and sustainability, including reviewing the Company\u2019s performance, policies and practices in relation to material environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) topics. The Board is assisted by its robust existing systems including audit, compliance, enterprise risk, financial, environmental, health and safety, human resource, information technology and operational management systems, along with the implementation of the Company\u2019s Longevity Reporting Framework (i.e. sustainability reporting framework). In addition, the Board assesses opportunities and risks presented by material ESG topics, and such assessment will be taken into consideration by the Board to determine the appropriate strategies, policies and practices that will provide the Company with the adaptability and flexibility to seize opportunities to deliver sustainable socio-economic value and progress to key stakeholders, while being well-supported by sound risk management. In determining the Company\u2019s risk appetite, the Board considers material ESG topics that may affect reputational risk, ethical and moral considerations, and have significant financial and non-financial implications.\nThe Company releases an annual standalone Sustainability Report. The FY2023 report will be available on the Company\u2019s corporate website at least two weeks prior to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d). The Sustainability Report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core Option and contains the components set out in Rule 711B of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST that are applicable to the Company in respect of FY2023.\nBoard Composition and Guidance\n\nPrinciple 2 -\nThe Board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.\nBoard Composition\nAs at the date of this Report, the Board members are:\n\nMr John Lim Kok Min | Chairman and Independent Non-Executive Director\nMr Wong Yu Wei (Huang Youwei) | Executive Deputy Chairman\nMr Chu Kok Hong @ Choo Kok Hong | Managing Director\nMr Chong Lit Cheong | Independent Non-Executive Director\nProfessor Yong Kwet Yew | Independent Non-Executive Director\nMr Tam Chee Chong | Independent Non-Executive Director\nBoard Independence\nAs set out in the section \u201cBoard Composition\u201d above, the Board currently comprises six directors, four of whom (including the Chairman of the Board) are independent non-executive directors. There is a strong and independent element on the Board with independent non-executive directors comprising a majority of the Board, and no individual or small group of individuals dominating the Board\u2019s decision-making. The Board is able to exercise objective judgement on corporate affairs independently, in particular, from Management. This ensures that key issues and strategies are critically reviewed, constructively challenged, fully discussed and thoroughly examined, taking into consideration the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.\nThe Nominating Committee assesses the independence of each director annually in accordance with the guidance in the Code, the Practice Guidance and the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST.

This was a non-cash transaction and had no impact on the consolidated cash flows. For details, see \u201c(9) Significant non-cash transactions\u201d under \u201cNote 44. Supplemental information to the consolidated statement of cash flows\u201d in \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in \u201cFinancial Report 2023.\u201d\nRefund and Redemption of Invested Funds Related to the Company sponsored SPACs\nThe Company sponsored SPACs execute an initial public offering and raise capital through contributions from the Public Market Investors. The proceeds received from the Public Market Investors are held in a trust account until completion of the initial merger or redemption to the Public Market Investors. If those SPACs are unable to complete a merger within 24 months from the date of the initial public offering and cease all operations, the funds in a trust account will be withdrawn and redeemed in full to the Public Market Investors. In such cases, the proceeds withdrawn from a trust account to the SPACs are recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated cash flow statements as \u201cProceeds from withdrawal of trust accounts in SPACs\u201d under cash flows from investing activities and, when subsequently redeemed to the Public Market Investors, as \u201cRedemption of non-controlling interests subject to possible redemption\u201d under cash flows from financing activities.\nSources of Capital and Liquidity\nSBG\u2019s sources of capital\nAs a strategic investment holding company, SBG invests in numerous companies through direct investments including subsidiaries and associates (including investments made through its subsidiaries), as well as through investment funds (e.g., SVF1, SVF2, and LatAm Funds). SBG\ncollects funds through the monetization of these holdings whenever deemed appropriate and via dividends from portfolio companies and distributions from investment funds. SBG allocates these proceeds to new investments based on its growth strategies, as well as redirecting them to shareholder returns and financial improvements at appropriate times. Additionally, SBG issues corporate bonds and borrows from financial institutions with the purpose of utilizing the proceeds for debt repayment and other purposes.\nIn terms of monetizing holdings, SBG employs diverse asset-backed finance, such as prepaid\nforward contracts and margin loans, in addition to outright sale of assets, enabling agile monetization of its assets. There is also an expectation of expanded opportunities for sale and monetisation as private equity investments become more liquid through listing, particularly those\n", "\nextensively pursued by SVF1, SVF2, and LatAm Funds.\nIn issuing corporate bonds, SBG issues not only yen-denominated senior notes but also bonds\nwith different product characteristics, such as U.S. dollar- or euro-denominated senior notes, and hybrid bonds. This approach allows SBG to secure funding opportunities from various domestic and international markets and ensure stable financing.\nSources of capital and liquidity in fiscal 2022\nIn fiscal 2022, SBG significantly curbed its investment activities in light of challenging market conditions. As a result, the total capital contributed by SBG to SVF1, SVF2, and LatAm Funds amounted to \u00a5415.3 billion ($3.10 billion), while the distributions received from these funds totaled \u00a5305.2 billion ($2.34 billion). As for financing activities, SBG raised \u00a55,236.9 billion ($39.02 billion, net) through ongoing monetization of assets, mainly shares in Alibaba. At the same time, as part of its shareholder return policy, SBG repurchased shares totaling \u00a51,055.4 billion. It also repaid margin loans and senior loans, resulting in a significant net debt reduction of \u00a52,368.8 billion.\nDue mainly to its continued defensive financial management as reflected in the above investing\nand financing activities, SBG\u2019s cash position at the end of fiscal 2022 stood at \u00a54,486.5 billion.* This figure, together with the \u00a5649.8 billion ($4.87 billion) available under commitment line, far exceeds the \u00a51,493.3 billion of bond redemptions over the next two years.\n* Cash and cash equivalents + short-term investments recorded current assets.

Tax Implications\nWhen a company purchases its own shares using its distributed profits or contributed capital, it will be regarded as any other disposal of shares by the shareholders from whom the shares are acquired.\nFor income tax purposes, whether or not the proceeds received by the Shareholders are taxable in the hands of the Shareholders who sell their Shares to the Company for which the purchases were made out of distributed profits or contributed capital will depend on whether such proceeds are receipts of an income or capital nature.\nShareholders should note that the foregoing is not to be regarded as advice on the tax position of any Shareholder. Shareholders who are in doubt as to their respective tax positions or the tax implications of Share purchases by the Company, or, who may be subject to tax whether in or outside Singapore, should consult their own professional advisers.\n11. Implications of Take-over Code\n11.1 Obligation to Make a Take-over Offer\nIf as a result of any purchase or acquisition by the Company of its Shares, a Shareholder\u2019s proportionate interest in the voting capital of the Company increases, such increase will be treated as an acquisition for the purposes of the Take-over Code. If such increase results in a change in control, or as a result of such increase a Shareholder or group of Shareholders acting in concert obtain or consolidate control, it may in certain circumstances give rise to an obligation on the part of such Shareholder or Shareholders to make a take-over offer under Rule 14 of the Take-over Code.\nThe circumstances under which Shareholders, including Directors and persons acting in concert with them respectively will incur an obligation to make a take-over offer under Rule 14 after a purchase of Shares by the Company are set out in Appendix 2 (\u201cTOC\nAppendix 2\u201d) of the Take-over Code.\nIn relation to Directors and persons acting in concert with them, Rule 14 provides that unless exempted (or if exempted, such exemption is subsequently revoked), Directors and persons acting in concert with them will incur an obligation to make a take-over offer if, as a result of a purchase of Shares by the Company:\n(a)\n\nthe percentage of voting rights held by such Directors and their concert parties in the Company\nincreases to 30% or more; or\n(b) if they together hold between 30% and 50% of the Company\u2019s voting rights, their voting rights increase by more than 1% in any period of six months.\nUnder TOC Appendix 2, a Shareholder not acting in concert with the Directors will not be required to make a take- over offer under Rule 14 if, as a result of the Company purchasing its Shares, the voting rights of such Shareholder would increase to 30% or more, or, if such Shareholder holds between 30% and 50% of the Company\u2019s voting rights, the voting rights of such Shareholder would increase by more than 1% in any period of six months. Such Shareholder need not abstain from voting in respect of the resolution authorising the Share Purchase Mandate.\n11.2 Persons Acting in Concert\nUnder the Take-over Code, persons acting in concert comprise individuals or companies who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal) co-operate, through the acquisition by any of them of shares in a company to obtain or consolidate control of that company. Unless the contrary is established, the following persons will, together with their close relatives, related trusts as well as companies controlled by any of the directors, their close relatives and related trusts; and (ii) a company, its parent company, subsidiaries and fellow subsidiaries, and their associated companies, and companies of which such companies are associated companies, all with each other. For this purpose, ownership or control of at least 20% but not more than 50% of the voting rights of a company will be regarded as the test of associated company status. inter alia, be presumed to be acting in concert: (i) a company with any of its directors,\n", "APPENDIX\n11.3 Effect of Rule 14 and Appendix 2 of the Take-over Code\nAs at the Latest Practicable Date, Mr Ong Yoke En (Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Company), Ms Lim Lay Yong (Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and wife of Mr Ong Yoke En), Mr Ong How En (brother of Mr Ong Yoke En) and Ms Ong Yoke Hoi (sister of Mr Ong Yoke En), who are deemed to be acting in concert with each other, collectively held 58.01% of the issued Shares. They would not be obliged to make a take-over offer under Rule 14 of the Take-over Code as a result of any purchase or acquisition of Shares by the Company pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate.\nShareholders who are in any doubt as to whether they would incur any obligation to make a take-over offer as a result of any purchase of Shares by the Company pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate are advised to consult their professional advisers and/or the SIC and/or other relevant authorities at the earliest opportunity before they acquire any Shares during the period when the Share Purchase Mandate is in force.\n12. Reporting Requirements\nWithin 30 days of the passing of the Shareholders\u2019 resolution to approve the Share Purchase Mandate, the Directors shall lodge a copy of such resolution with the Registrar.\nThe Directors shall lodge with the Registrar a notice of Share purchase within 30 days of a Share purchase.

Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\n2.18 Employee compensation\nEmployee benefits are recognised as an expense, unless the cost qualifies to be capitalised as an asset.\n(a) Defined contribution plans\nDefined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into separate entities such as the Central Provident Fund on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\n(b) Short-term compensated absences\nEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. An accrual is made for the estimated liability for unutilised annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date.\n(c) Profit sharing and bonus plan\nThe Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the Company\u2019s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision when contractually obliged to pay or when there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation to pay.\n", "NOTES TO TH E\nFI NANCIAL STATEM EN TS\nFor the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2023\n2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n2.18 Employee compensation (continued)\n(d) Performance share\nBenefits to employees including the directors are provided in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby certain prescribed performance targets are met and/or upon expiry of prescribe vesting periods.\nThe fair value of the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awarded or granted. The amount is determined by reference to the fair value of the performance shares on the grant date.\nThe fair value is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period of the performance shares scheme, with the corresponding increase in equity. The value of charge is adjusted in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of shares vesting, with the adjustment made in equity. Cancellations of grants of equity instruments during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied) are accounted as an acceleration of vesting, therefore any amount unrecognised that would otherwise have been charged is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n2.19 Currency translation\n(a) Functional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (\u201cfunctional currency\u201d). The financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars (\"$\"), which is the functional currency of the Company.\n(b) Transactions and balances\nTransactions in a currency other than the functional currency (\u201cforeign currency\u201d) are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of transactions. Currency exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing rates at the reporting date are recognised in profit or loss. Monetary items include primarily financial assets (other than equity investments) and financial liabilities.\nHowever, in the consolidated financial statements, currency translation differences arising from other currency instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges and net investment in foreign operations, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the currency translation reserve.\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of or any loan forming part of the net investment of the foreign operation is repaid, a proportionate share of the accumulated currency translation differences is reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\nAll other foreign exchange gains and losses impacting profit or loss are presented in the income statement within \u201cOther (losses)/gains - net\u201d.\n", "NOTES TO TH E\nFI NANCIAL STATEM EN TS\nFor the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2023\n2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n2.19 Currency translation (continued)\n(b) Transactions and balances (continued)\nNon-monetary items measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined.\n(c) Translation of Group entities\u2019 financial statements\nThe results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n(i) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates at the reporting date;\n(ii) income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless the average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of transactions); and\n(iii) all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the currency translation reserve. These currency translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the entity giving rise to such reserve.\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and translated at the closing rates at the reporting date.\n2.20 Segment reporting\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board of Directors whose members are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.\n2.21 Cash and cash equivalents\nFor the purpose of presentation in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. For cash subjected to restriction, assessment is made on the economic substance of the restriction and whether they meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents.\n2.22 Share capital and treasury shares\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares are deducted against the share capital account.\nWhen any entity within the Group purchases the Company\u2019s ordinary shares (\u201ctreasury shares\u201d), the carrying amount which includes the consideration paid and any directly attributable transaction cost is presented as a component within equity attributable to the Company\u2019s equity holders, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHR4OFY_Japan Foods Holding Ltd._20230705065716_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [123, 126]}, {"question": "What is the date of the Thirty-Seventh Annual General Meeting of Advanced Systems Automation Limited?", "answer": "Wednesday, 28 June 2023 at 10.00 a.m.", "raw_text": "What is the date of the Thirty-Seventh Annual General Meeting of Advanced Systems Automation Limited?\n###ANSWER: Wednesday, 28 June 2023 at 10.00 a.m.", "pages": ["\u201cAGM\u201d\n\u201cAppendix\u201d\n\u201cAnnual Report 2022\u201d\n\n\u201cAssociates\u201d\n\u201cASTI\u201d\n\n\u201cASTI Group\u201d\n\u201cASTI Corporate Support Services\u201d\n\n\u201cASTI Corporate Support\nServices Payments\u201d\n\n\u201cASTI Corporate Support\nServices Agreement\u201d\n\u201cAudit Committee\u201d\n\u201cBoard\u201d or \"Board of Directors\"\n\u201cCatalist\u201d\n\n\u201cCatalist Rules\u201d\n\u201cCDP\u201d\n\u201cChief Executive Officer\u201d\n\n\u201cCompanies Act\u201d\n\u201cCompany\u201d\n\n\u201cConstitution\u201d\n\u201cControlling Shareholder\u201d\n\u201cDirector\u201d\nDEFINITIONS\n: The annual general meeting of the Shareholders\n: This appendix dated 13 June 2023\n: Refers to the annual report for the financial year ended 31 December 2022\n\n:   (a)\nin relation to any Director, Chief Executive Officer, Substantial Shareholder or Controlling Shareholder (being an individual) means:\n\ni.   his immediate family;\nii. the trustees of any trust of which he or his immediate family is a beneficiary or, in the case of a discretionary trust, is a discretionary object;

These guarantees are financial guarantee contracts as they require the Company to reimburse the banks if the subsidiary fails to make principal or interest payments when due in accordance with the terms of the facilities drawn. The earliest period that the guarantees could be called is within 1 year (2020: 1 year) from the end of the reporting period. The maximum amount that the Company could be forced to settle under these financial guarantee contracts, if the full guaranteed amount is claimed, is $3,443,000 (2021: $2,639,000). The Company considers that it is more likely than not that no amount will be payable in respect of the financial guarantees as its subsidiaries have the financial capacity to meet the contractual cash flow obligations, hence the Company has not recognised any liability in respect of the corporate guarantees.\n32 Fair value of assets and liabilities\nFair value hierarchy\nThe tables below analyse the fair value measurements by the levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques.

As a part of this review, management considers the cost of capital; and the tenures and risks associated with each class of capital. Management monitors its liquidity based on three months-rolling cashflow projections. Management also reviews compliance with financial covenants associated with borrowings at least on an annual basis. The Group balances its overall capital structure through issuance of new debt, capitalisation of existing debts or issuance of new shares.

(\u201cShanghai Snow Star\u201d)\nAs disclosed in Notes 21 and 32 to the financial statements, the Group is currently undergoing arbitration proceedings in the Shanghai International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSHIAC\u201d) with its partners (\u201cApplicants\u201d) in an indirectly held joint venture company (\u201cJVC\u201d), Shanghai Snow Star Properties Co., Ltd (\u201cShanghai Snow Star\u201d).\nOn 29 November 2021, SHIAC issued a partial judgment in which it was decided that (i) the Framework Agreement and the Investment Agreement that were entered into with Shanghai LuJiaZui Zhi Mao Investment Co., Ltd and Shanghai Hong Bin Properties Co., Ltd. (\u201cformer joint venture partners\u201d) are to be retrospectively terminated on 20 December 2020; and (ii) the former joint venture partners are required to acquire the Group\u2019s 30% equity interests in the JVC at a fair market value, based on the average of the valuation provided by two China-qualified valuers appointed by the Applicants and the Company respectively. Due to the issuance of the partial judgment, the Group has reclassified its interest in Shanghai Snow Star from an investment in a joint venture to non-current assets held for sale, in line with management\u2019s expectations that the investment would be disposed of within the next 12 months from 29 November 2021. Further details of the arbitration proceedings are disclosed in Notes 21 and 32.\nManagement informed that on the date of reclassification, the carrying amount of the asset, amounting to $107,599,000, comprises the sum of (i) the historical costs of investment and (ii) the group\u2019s share of Shanghai Snow Star\u2019s results from the date of investment, up to the date of reclassification.\nThroughout the duration of the arbitration proceedings, the Group has experienced difficulties in obtaining certain relevant financial information from Shanghai Snow Star. In addition, we and our component auditors were also not granted access to Shanghai Snow Star\u2019s accounting records and other relevant information required for our audit for the financial years ended 31 March 2022 and its preceding financial year. Accordingly, we are unable to perform any audit procedures nor any other alternative means to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to determine whether the carrying amount of the Group\u2019s investments in joint ventures (now reclassified as non-current asset held for sale) of $103,167,000 as at 31 March 2021, or the Group\u2019s share of the results from investments in joint ventures for the current financial year have been accurately recognised.\nConsequently, in view of the above, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments to the carrying amount of the Group\u2019s investment in joint venture (now reclassified as non-current asset held for sale) of $107,599,000 as at 31 March 2022 were necessary.\nIn addition, management has also not reclassified the investment in joint venture to non-current asset held for sale in the comparatives given that the partial judgment on 29 November 2021 had terminated the JVC agreement retrospectively on 20 November 2020.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (\u201cSSAs\u201d). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (\u201cACRA\u201d) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (\u201cACRA Code\u201d) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.

Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the balance sheet date (e.g. the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant). The amendments also clarify what SFRS(I) 1-1 means when it refers to the \u2018settlement\u2019 of a liability.\nThe amendments could affect the classification of liabilities, particularly for entities that previously considered management\u2019s intentions to determine classification and for some liabilities that can be converted into equity.\nThe Group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.\nAmendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024)\nThe amendments clarify that covenants of loan arrangements which an entity must comply with only after the balance sheet date would not affect classification of a liability as current or non-current at the balance sheet date. However, those covenants that an entity is required to comply with on or before the balance sheet date would affect the classification as current or non-current, even if the covenant is only assessed after the entity\u2019s balance sheet date.\nThe amendments also introduce additional disclosure requirements to enable users to understand the risk that the liability could be repayable within twelve months of the reporting period, when an entity classifies a liability arising from a loan arrangement as non-current and that liability is subject to the covenants which an entity is required to comply with within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nThe Group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.\n34.

RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Continued)\n(b) Foreign currency risk\nThe Group\u2019s transactions are mainly denominated in RMB, US$ and HK$. Certain trade receivables, deposits, bank deposits, trade payables, accrued expenses and bank borrowings of the Group are denominated in US$ and HK$ which are not the functional currencies of the group entities to which these balances relate, and the Group is therefore exposed to foreign currency risk. To mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, the management continuously assesses and monitors foreign exchange exposure.\nThe Group\u2019s foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities, translated into RMB at the closing rates, are as follows:\n\n2023 | 2022\nUS$   HK$ | US$   HK$\nRMB\u2019000   RMB\u2019000 | RMB\u2019000   RMB\u2019000\nFinancial assets:\n\n- Trade receivables | 6,897 | \u2013 | 9,922 | \u2013\n- Cash and bank balances | 5,965 | 288 | 12,511 | 184\n | 12,862 | 288 | 22,433 | 184\nFinancial liabilities\n\n- Bank borrowings | \u2013 | \u2013 | (16,107) | \u2013\n | \u2013 | \u2013 | 6,326 | 184\nThe directors are of the opinion that sensitivity of the Group\u2019s profit after tax and accumulated loss to a reasonable change in the foreign currency rates are assessed to be immaterial. Changes in foreign currency rates have no impact on the Group\u2019s other components of equity.\nAs the Company does not have exposure to foreign currency risk, the Company\u2019s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in foreign currency rates.\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group\u2019s receivables from customers and financial assets. The Group\u2019s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade and other receivables, and cash and bank balances.\nNo other financial assets carry a significant exposure to credit risk. None of the financial assets of the Group and the Company are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets recorded in the financial statements grossed up for any allowance for losses, represent the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk for the year ended 30 June 2023 and 2022.\n", "NOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023\n30. RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Continued)\n(c) Credit risk (Continued)\nThe management has a credit policy and the exposures to credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group trades mainly with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group\u2019s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. Major concentration of credit risk arises from the Group\u2019s exposure to top 5 (2022: 5) major trade debtors who contributed approximately 27% (2022: 22%) of the trade receivables balance of the Group.\nThe management has made individual assessment on the recoverability of other receivables and deposits based on historical settlement records, past experience, and also forward- looking information, as appropriate. The Group has considered the consistently low historical default rate in connection with payments, and concluded that credit risk inherent in the Group\u2019s outstanding other receivables and deposits is insignificant.\nAll the Group\u2019s cash and bank balances are deposited with major financial institutions located in the PRC and Hong Kong, including an aggregated balance of approximately RMB20,593,000 (2022: RMB23,542,000) representing 86% (2022: 79%) of the reporting date balances maintained with 3 banks (2022: 3) which are rated A2 to A1, based on Moody\u2019s ratings.\nThe Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. The ECL on trade receivables is estimated using a provision matrix with reference to past default experience of the debtor, current market condition in relation to each debtor\u2019s exposure. The ECL also incorporated forward looking information with reference to general macroeconomic conditions that may a\ufb00ect the ability of the debtors to settle receivables.\nAs at 30 June 2023 and 2022, the Group recognised lifetime ECL for its trade receivables based on individually significant customer or the ageing of customers collectively that are not individually significant as follows:\n\n | Expected   credit loss   rate | Gross   carrying   amount   RMB\u2019000 | Loss   allowance   RMB\u2019000\nAt 30 June 2023\n\nCurrent | 1.87% | 66,892 | 1,254\nLess than 1 month past due | 5.27% | 9,996 | 527\n1 to 3 months past due | 7.22% | 2,617 | 189\nMore than 3 months but less than 12 months past due | 17.27% | 139 | 24\nMore than 12 months past due | 20.26% | 153   79,797 | 31   2,025\nAt 30 June 2022\n\nCurrent | 2.17% | 75,370 | 1,637\nLess than 1 month past due | 6.14% | 3,148 | 193\n1 to 3 months past due | 8.42% | 1,008 | 85\nMore than 3 months but less than 12 months past due | 22.58% | 431 | 97\nMore than 12 months past due | 31.67% | 41   79,998 | 13   2,025\n", "\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023\n30.

In order to maintain or achieve an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend payment, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back issued shares, obtain new borrowings or sell assets to reduce borrowings.\nThe capital structure of the Group mainly consists of equity and the Group\u2019s overall strategy remains unchanged from financial year ended 31 May 2022.\nSubsequent events 33\nOn 27 June 2023, the Group has entered into a term sheet (\u201cTerm Sheet\u201d) which summarises the principal terms of a proposed share subscription by Future Fields Pte. Ltd. (\u201cFFPL\u201d) of 60% of the enlarged issued and paid-up share capital of the Group\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary Marvel Distribution Sdn Bhd (\u201cMDSB\u201d) as the first share subscription (\u201cFirst Share Subscription\u201d) and a second proposed subscription of an additional 10% of the enlarged issued and paid-up share capital of MDSB (\u201cSecond Share Subscription\ufffd\ufffd). The Term Sheet is not legally binding and there will be no obligation to issue or subscribe for any shares in the MDSB until a legally binding definitive agreement is signed. The completion of the share subscription will result in a dilution of the Company\u2019s shareholdings initially to 40% of MDSB upon the First Share Subscription and subsequently to 30% of MDSB upon the Second Share Subscription. MDSB will cease to be a subsidiary of the Group after completion of the First Share Subscription.\nAs of the reporting date, the potential financial impact of the dilution of the Group\u2019s stake in MDSB cannot be reliably determined as the process of legal due diligence is still ongoing and the terms of the share subscription agreements have yet to be finalised.\n34 Authorisation of financial statements\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company for the financial year ended 31 May 2023 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors dated 29 August 2023.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSTATISTICS OF SHAREHOLDINGS\nAS AT 16 AUGUST 2023\nNUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED (EXCLUDING TREASURY SHARES) : 108,803,600\n\nISSUED AND FULLY PAID-UP CAPITAL\nNUMBER OF TREASURY SHARES\nNUMBER OF SUBSIDIARY HOLDINGS\nCLASS OF SHARES\nVOTING RIGHTS   :\n51,850,444 5,596,400 (5.14%) NIL :\n\n:\n:   ORDINARY SHARES   ONE VOTE PER SHARE\n:\nNO.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:\nLevel 1 : Level 2 :\t\u0007inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nprices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data. Level 3 :\n23.2 Determination of fair values\nFair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.\nFinancial instruments whose carrying amounts approximate fair value\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at their amortised costs with a maturity of less than one year (including loans and advances and other receivables (excluding prepayments and income tax recoverable), cash and cash equivalents and other payables) approximate their fair values because of the short period to maturity. Management has determined the fair value of these financial instruments to closely approximate their carrying amount at the reporting date.\nThe fair value of the non-current receivables is an approximation to their carrying values at the reporting date. They are estimated by discounted cash flow analysis using discount rate based on market rate for similar instrument at inception.\nThe Company and the Group do not anticipate that the carrying amounts recorded at the end of the reporting period would be significantly different from the values that would eventually be received or settled.\nLease liabilities\nThe fair value disclosure of lease liabilities is not required.\nProperties held by Jetwin (Level 3)\nThe following table shows the professional valuer\u2019s valuation technique used in measuring the fair value of properties held by Jetwin, as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.\nInter-relationship between key unobservable inputs and fair value measurement\nValuation technique Significant unobservable inputs\n\n | The estimated fair value would   increase (decrease) if: | \nDirect comparison method | Price per square meter was higher (lower) | Price per square meter of market comparables:\n | - Fully completed apartment | - 31 December 2021: HK$25,678 to HK$30,293   - 31 December 2022: HK$23,101 to HK$31,078\n- \u0007Residential apartment under\n- 31 December 2022: HK$17,061 to HK$60,214 improvement\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230613OTHRVT4V_Net Pacific Financial Holdings Limited_20230613203935_00_AR_4Q_20221231.1.pdf", "page_number": [6, 9]}, {"question": "What is the total cost of sales, selling and distribution and administrative expenses for Boustead Projects Limited for the financial year ended 31 March 2023?", "answer": "$273,870,000", "raw_text": "What is the total cost of sales, selling and distribution and administrative expenses for Boustead Projects Limited for the financial year ended 31 March 2023?\n###ANSWER:\n$273,870,000", "pages": ["120 Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n5.

Fair value of assets and liabilities\n(a) Fair value hierarchy\nThe Group categorises fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:\n(i) Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n(ii) Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\n(iii) Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data\n(unobservable inputs).\n(b) Fair value measurements of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\nThe following table presents the level of fair value hierarchy for each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on the statements of financial position at the end of the reporting period:\nGroup and Company\n\nLevel 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total\n$\u2019000 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000\nRecurring fair value measurements Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets at FVTPL | \u2013 | \u2013 | 5,447 | 5,447\nRecurring fair value measurements Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets at FVTPL | \u2013 | \u2013 | 5,506 | 5,506\nThe valuation technique to determine fair values of the financial assets at FVTPL are disclosed in Note 17.\n(c)\n\nFair value of financial instruments by classes that are not carried at fair value and whose\ncarrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair value\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements of the Group and the Company approximate their fair values, either due to their short-term nature or that they are floating rate instruments that are re-priced to market interest rates on or near the end of the reporting period or that there are no significant changes in the interest borrowing rates available to the Group at the end of the reporting period.\n(d) Valuation process applied by the Group\nThe fair values of unquoted investments are determined by an external professional valuer having appropriate professional qualifications and experience in valuing such investments. For valuation performed by external valuers, management considers the appropriateness of the valuation technique and assumptions applied by the external valuers. The measurement of fair values of other assets and liabilities within Level 3 fair value hierarchy is performed by the Group\u2019s finance team on annual basis. If third party quotes or pricing information are used to measure fair value, the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to assess if such valuations meet the SFRS(I) and the fair value level hierarchy the measurement should be classified in. The valuation reports and changes in fair value measurements are analysed and reported to the Group\u2019s Deputy Chief Financial O\ufb03cer and directors regularly. Significant valuation issues are reported to the Audit Committee.\n", "\n |  |  | Adjustments   and\n |  | operations | \n | (Continued):   follows   as   are | Discontinued | \n | segments   reportable   the   for   management | operations   Continuing | \n(Continued)   information   Segment   34. | to   provided   information   segment   The |  | \n\neliminations | $\u2019000 | (371) 371\nThailand | $\u2019000 | 762 \u2013\nSingapore 1,092 \u2013 $\u2019000\n\n | \u2013 \u2013\nUSA $\u2019000 | \n\nIndonesia | $\u2019000 | 6,327 (115)\nSingapore | $\u2019000 | 4,915 \u2013\n\n | revenue | revenue\n2022 | segment   Total | Intersegment\n\n\u2013 | (1,683) | (87) | 87\n(46) \u2013\n(34) \u2013 (3)\nparties\n\nexternal   from   revenue   Total | t   (loss)/profi   Operating | income   Interest | costs   Finance\nFinancial Statements\n(46) \u2013 \u2013\n(37) \u2013\nequity- associate tax\nfrom before credit year for losses t accounted tax (Loss)/profi of\nfor Income Share Loss\nNotes to the\nFor the financial year ended 31 May 2023\n4,201 \u2013\n10 \u2013\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n14 \u2013 \u2013\n297 \u2013 \u2013\n3,368 981 \u2013\nplant loss items assets amortisation credit property, non-cash contract expected on\nand and equipment on equipment on cant loss\nfor Depreciation the nancial signifi Impairment expenses Allowance Other fi and and of\n1,450 \u2013\n(558) \u2013 \u2013 17\n4,076 110 \u2013 2\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\u2013 130 89\n\u2013 8,039 1,003\n\u2013 66,098 4,626\nadditions\nof\ninclude assets disposal\nnon-current assets assets subsidiaries Gain/(loss) Segment Segment Assets to\n2,028 \u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nliabilities\nLiabilities Segment\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 May 2023\n34.

GSH is a Controlling Shareholder and has an interest of more than 30% of the total issued shares in the capital of TYJ. As a result, GSH is deemed interested in the shares of the Company owned by TYJ, a Controlling Shareholder of the Company. GSH and the GSH Associates would be \u201cInterested Persons\u201d within the meaning of Rule 904 of the Catalist Rules. As such, transactions between the Group\nand its Associated Companies and GSH and the GSH Associates will constitute \u201cInterested Person Transactions\u201d\nunder Chapter 9 of the Catalist Rules.\nThe IPT Mandate was proposed to enable the Entities at Risk to enter into the categories of recurrent transactions (more particularly set out in paragraph 4.4 of this Appendix) in the ordinary course of its business with the GSH Interested Group (more particularly set out in paragraph 4.2 of this Appendix), provided that such transactions will be carried out on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and/or its minority Shareholders.\n4.2 Classes of Interested Persons\nThe IPT Mandate will apply to the transactions that are carried out between any entity in the Tung Lok Target Group and the GSH Interested Group.\n4.3 Scope of the IPT Mandate\nThe IPT Mandate will apply to any transaction within the categories of IPTs as set out in paragraph 4.4 of this Appendix arising from the ordinary course of business of the Tung Lok Target Group. Accordingly, any transaction entered into pursuant to the IPT Mandate will be included for the purposes of aggregation for the thresholds as stated in paragraph 4.7 of this Appendix.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the IPT Mandate will cover transactions below S$100,000 in value, notwithstanding that the threshold and aggregation requirements of Chapter 9 of the Catalist Rules as at the Latest Practicable Date do not apply to such transactions.\nTransactions between the Entity at Risk with Interested Persons that do not fall within the ambit of the IPT Mandate will be subject to the relevant provisions of Chapter 9 of the Catalist Rules and/or any applicable provisions of the Catalist Rules.\n4.4 Categories of IPTs\nThe categories of IPTs which will be covered by the IPT Mandate are as set out below:\n(a) Purchase of finished products from the GSH Interested Group\nThe Tung Lok Target Group may from time to time purchase finished products (including dim sum and mooncakes) from the GSH Interested Group. The GSH Interested Group has its own production facilities and is in the business of manufacturing and selling various food products.\n(b) Sale of mooncakes to the GSH Interested Group\nThe Tung Lok Target Group may tap into the local and overseas distribution network of the GSH Interested Group (particularly, the TYJ Group) by selling its Tung Lok brand of mooncakes to the relevant entities of the GSH Interested Group.\n", "\nLETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n4.5 Rationale for and Benefits of the IPT Mandate\nThe Tung Lok Target Group and the GSH Interested Group are in related businesses, and have been transacting with each other, in the ordinary course of business. The Tung Lok Target Group and the GSH Interested Group intend to continue with such recurrent transactions (the \u201cRecurrent IPTs\u201d) in the future.\nAccordingly, the IPT Mandate is to enable the Tung Lok Target Group to enter into the Recurrent IPTs with the Interested Persons in the ordinary course of business, provided such transactions will be carried out on normal commercial terms and are not prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority Shareholders.\nThe Directors believe that the IPT Mandate is in the interests of the Group for the following reasons:\n(a) It will be beneficial to the Group to allow the Recurrent IPTs, provided that they are carried out on normal commercial terms, and are not prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority Shareholders. The Recurrent IPTs will enable the Tung Lok Target Group to benefit from the expertise and available resources of the GSH Interested Group;\n(b) The IPT Mandate will facilitate entry into the Recurrent IPTs with the GSH Interested Group in the ordinary course of the Tung Lok Target Group\u2019s businesses since the Tung Lok Target Group has been procuring finished products (including dim sum and mooncakes) from the GSH Interested Group. It is crucial that the Tung Lok Target Group maintains continuity of supplies and consistency of quality for those food supplies so that the provision of food and related services to the consumers of the Tung Lok Target Group\u2019s restaurant outlets and catering services will not be unduly disrupted; and\n(c) The Recurrent IPTs will occur frequently at differing intervals. The IPT Mandate and any subsequent renewals of the same on an annual basis are intended to facilitate the Recurrent IPTs in the day-to-day transactions of the Tung Lok Target Group and will eliminate the need to prepare and make announcements and/or convene separate general meetings on a continual basis to seek prior approval for the entry into these transactions, which will serve to minimize disruptions to our food supply and improve operational efficiency in a cost-effective manner. Furthermore, the IPT Mandate will give the Tung Lok Target Group and the GSH Interested Group the flexibility to conduct the Recurrent IPTs in the ordinary course of business, thereby reducing the time and expenses which would otherwise be incurred to convene general meetings on an ad hoc basis, and allow such resources and time to be channeled towards the management of the Group\u2019s business.\n4.6 Guidelines and review procedures for the Recurrent IPTs under the IPT Mandate\nThe IPT Mandate incorporates the following guidelines and review procedures for the following Recurrent IPTs:\n(a) Purchase of finished products from the GSH Interested Group\nThe purchase of finished products from the GSH Interested Group will be carried out on terms comparable or more favourable to the Tung Lok Target Group than those offered by unrelated third-party suppliers to the Tung Lok Target Group.\nThe purchase prices of these finished products will be routinely reviewed by a committee (the \u201cIPT Review\nCommittee\u201d), comprising representatives from the senior management team of the Company who are familiar with the Tung Lok Target Group\u2019s businesses. The IPT Review Committee shall comprise persons who are independent of the GSH Interested Group and approved by the Audit and Risk Committee.\nPrior to any entry of a transaction with the GSH Interested Group for a new finished product, quotes shall be obtained (wherever possible or available) from at least two (2) other unrelated third-party suppliers for similar finished products and at similar quantities for comparison. In determining whether the price and terms offered by the GSH Interested Group for the new finished product are fair and reasonable, the relevant entity in the Tung Lok Target Group will take into account relevant factors (other than price) including, but not limited to, delivery schedules, quality of products, credit terms, customer requirements and specifications, track record of counter-parties, overall services provided, costs and/or expenses (including, inter alia, storage, shipment and transportation) borne by each party, availability of preferential rates, rebates or discount and cost of freight.\n", "LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\nFor existing finished products which the Tung Lok Target Group has been purchasing from the GSH Interested Group, at least two (2) quotations from unrelated third parties for similar finished products and at similar quantities will be obtained at least half-yearly for comparison with the quotations from the GSH Interested Group. In determining whether the price and terms offered by the GSH Interested Group are fair and reasonable, relevant factors (other than price) including, but not limited to, delivery schedules, quality of products, credit terms, customer requirements and specifications, track record of counter-parties, overall services provided, costs and/or expenses (including, inter alia, storage, shipment and transportation) borne by each party, availability of preferential rates, rebates or discount and cost of freight will be taken into account.\nIn the event that two (2) quotations from unrelated third parties are not available, the IPT Review Committee will determine the reasonableness of the quote offered by the GSH Interested Group in accordance with the Group\u2019s usual business practices and pricing policies or industry norms (as the case may be), taking into account relevant factors including, but not limited to, the nature of the product, order quantity, delivery schedules, quality of products, credit terms, customer requirements and specifications, track record of counter-parties, overall services provided, costs and/or expenses (including, inter alia, storage, shipment and transportation) borne by each party, availability of preferential rates, discounts or rebates and cost of freight.\n(b) Sale of mooncakes to the GSH Interested Group\nIn respect of the sale of mooncakes by the Tung Lok Target Group to the GSH Interested Group, the selling price of agreed items of mooncakes (\u201cSale List Items\u201d) by the Tung Lok Target Group to the GSH Interested Group are fixed at a predetermined percentage discount to the relevant market selling price from time to time (the \u201cSale Price Formula\u201d). The Sale Price Formula for sales to the GSH Interested Group is fixed by the IPT Review Committee. In determining the Sale Price Formula, the IPT Review Committee will take into account the usual business practices and pricing policies of the Tung Lok Target Group to ensure that the sale of mooncakes by the Tung Lok Target Group to the GSH Interested Group is carried out at prevailing market rates and on terms which are no more favourable than the usual commercial terms extended by the Tung Lok Target Group to unrelated third party customers (taking into consideration, where appropriate, preferential rates/ prices/ discounts accorded for high volume purchases). Any subsequent adjustments to the Sale Price Formula or the adoption of any new Sales Price Formulas shall be approved by the IPT Review Committee prior to making any sales to the GSH Interested Group. The IPT Review Committee shall inform the Audit and Risk Committee of any significant adjustments to the Sale Price Formula or the adoption of any new Sale Price Formula.\nPrior to entering into a sales transaction with the GSH Interested Group for the Sale List Items, the relevant entity in the Tung Lok Target Group will take into account relevant factors (other than price) including, but not limited to, the strategic reasons for the transaction, volume of the transaction, delivery schedules, quality of products, credit terms, customer requirements and specifications, and track record of counter-parties, overall services provided, costs and/or expenses (including, inter alia, storage, shipment and transportation) borne by each party and whether the sales are designated for export or for local markets.\n4.7 Threshold Limits\nIn addition to the review procedures, the following approval procedures will be implemented to supplement existing internal control procedures for the Recurrent IPTs to ensure that such transactions are undertaken on an arm\u2019s length basis and on normal commercial terms:\n(a) Threshold for individual Recurrent IPTs\nTransactions between the Tung Lok Target Group and the GSH Interested Group:\n(i) Where an individual Recurrent IPT is in excess of S$200,000, such transaction will require the prior approval of the Audit and Risk Committee;\n(ii) Where an individual Recurrent IPT is in excess of S$30,000 but equal to or below S$200,000, such transaction will be approved by the President/Chief Executive Officer of the Company, who is independent of the GSH Interested Group;\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230712OTHR5SZY_Tung Lok Restaurants (2000) Ltd_20230712002020_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [15, 18]}, {"question": "What is the maximum price for a share in relation to market purchases by the company?", "answer": "The maximum price for a share in relation to market purchases by the company is not more than 5% above the average of the closing market prices of the shares over the last five (5) market days, on which transactions in the share were recorded, before the day on which the purchases are made and deemed to be adjusted for any corporate action that occurs during the relevant five (5) market days period and the day on which the purchases are made.", "raw_text": "What is the maximum price for a share in relation to market purchases by the company?\n###ANSWER:\nThe maximum price for a share in relation to market purchases by the company is not more than 5% above the average of the closing market prices of the shares over the last five (5) market days, on which transactions in the share were recorded, before the day on which the purchases are made and deemed to be adjusted for any corporate action that occurs during the relevant five (5) market days period and the day on which the purchases are made.", "pages": ["\nLETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\nShareholders should note that the financial effects illustrated above, based on the respective aforesaid assumptions, are for illustrative purposes only.

The Company will take into account both financial and non-financial factors (for example, stock market conditions and the performance of the Shares) in assessing the relative impact of a Share purchase before execution.\n8. TAX IMPLICATIONS\nShareholders who are in doubt as to their respective tax positions or any such tax implications or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than Singapore should consult their own professional advisers.\n9. INTERESTED PERSONS\nThe Company is prohibited from knowingly buying Shares on Catalist from an interested person, that is, a Director, the chief executive officer of the Company or Controlling Shareholder of the Company or any of their Associates, and an interested person is prohibited from knowingly selling his/her Shares to the Company.\n10. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT\nWithin 30 days of the passing of a Shareholders\u2019 resolution to approve the purchases of Shares by the Company, the Company shall lodge a copy of such resolution with ACRA. Within 30 days of a purchase of Shares on Catalist or otherwise, the Company shall lodge with ACRA the notice of the purchase in the prescribed form, such notification including, the total number of Shares purchased by the Company, the total number of Shares cancelled, the number of Shares held as Treasury Shares, the Company\u2019s issued ordinary share capital before and after the purchase of Shares, the amount of consideration paid by the Company for the purchase, and whether the Shares were purchased out of the profits or the capital of the Company. inter alia, details of the purchase,\n11. CATALIST RULES\nPublic float\nThe Catalist Rules requires a listed company to ensure that at least 10% of the total number of any class of its listed securities must be held by public shareholders. The \u201cpublic\u201d, as defined under the Catalist Rules, are persons other than the Directors, CEO, Substantial Shareholders or Controlling Shareholders of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as the associates of such persons.\nAs at the Latest Practicable Date, approximately 30.48% of the issued share capital of the Company is held in the hands of the public. Assuming that the Company purchased the maximum of 10% of its issued share capital as at the Latest Practicable Date from members of the public by way of a Market Purchase, the percentage of Shares held by the public would be reduced to approximately 22.75%.\n", "LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\nAccordingly, the Company is of the view that there is a sufficient number of issued Shares held in the hands of the public which would permit the Company to undertake purchases or acquisitions of its issued Shares up to the full 10% limit pursuant to the Share Buy-Back Mandate without affecting the listing status of the Shares on the SGX-ST, and that the number of Shares remaining in the hands of the public will not fall to such a level as to cause market illiquidity or to adversely affect the orderly trading of Shares.\nThe Directors will use their best efforts to ensure that the Company does not effect buy-back of Shares if the buy-back of Shares would result in the number of Shares remaining in the hands of the public falling to such a level as to cause market illiquidity or adversely affect the listing status of the Company or adversely affect the orderly trading of the Shares.\nMaximum Price\nUnder the Catalist Rules, a listed company may only purchase shares by way of a market acquisition at a price which is not more than 5% above the average of the closing market prices of the Shares over the last five (5) market days, on which transactions in the Share were recorded, before the day on which the purchases are made and deemed to be adjusted for any corporate action that occurs during the relevant five (5) market days period and the day on which the purchases are made. The Maximum Price for a Share in relation to Market Purchases by the Company, referred to in Section 3.4 of this Appendix, conforms to this restriction.\nDisclosure Requirements\nAdditionally, the Catalist Rules also specifies that a listed company shall report all purchases or acquisitions of its shares to the SGX-ST not later than 9.00 a.m.:\n(a) in the case of a Market Purchase, on the Market Day following the day of purchase of any of its Shares; and\n(b) in the case of an Off-Market Purchase under an equal access scheme, on the second Market Day after the close of acceptances of the offer.\nSuch announcement shall include, purchase, the date of purchase, the total number of Shares purchased, the purchase price per Share or (in the case of Market Purchases) the purchase price per Share or the highest price and lowest price per Share, the total consideration paid for the Shares and the number of issued Shares after purchase, in the form prescribed under the Catalist Rules. inter alia, details of the total number of Shares authorised for\nDealing in Securities\nWhile the Catalist Rules does not expressly prohibit any purchase of Shares by a listed company during any particular time, because the listed company would be regarded as an \u201cinsider\u201d in relation to any proposed purchase or acquisition of its issued Shares, the Company will not undertake any purchase or acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Share Buy-Back Mandate at any time after any matter or development of a price-sensitive nature has occurred or has been the subject of consideration and/or a decision of the Board until such price-sensitive information has been publicly announced.\nFurther, in conformity with the best practices on dealing with securities under the Catalist Rules, the Company will not purchase or acquire any Shares during the period commencing one (1) month before the announcement of the Company\u2019s half year and full year financial statements, and ending on the date of announcement of the relevant results.\n", "\nLETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n12.

The various fees earned by the Manager are further elaborated below:\n(i) Base fee\nThe Manager is responsible for the ongoing management of the assets and liabilities of AA REIT for the benefit of the Unitholders. Accordingly, the Manager should be fairly compensated for its efforts in the overall management of AA REIT and it should enable the Manager to cover its operational, administrative and compliance overheads incurred in the management of the portfolio. The base management fee is calculated as a percentage of the Deposited Property (as defined in the Trust Deed) of AA REIT as it provides an appropriate metric to determine the resources required for managing the assets. As AA REIT grows its portfolio size, the complexity of management increases and the Manager is expected to expend greater effort in fulfilling its responsibilities.\n(ii) Performance fee\nThe performance fee is only payable when the Manager has achieved certain levels of growth in the Distribution per Unit (\u201cDPU\u201d) in the current financial year relative to the previous financial year. As the year-on-year growth of the DPU is in line with the interests of the Unitholders, the performance fee will spur the Manager to seek growth opportunities or embark on cost savings initiatives to improve the performance of AA REIT. The performance fee is calculated as a percentage of the Deposited Property (as defined in the Trust Deed) of AA REIT as it provides an appropriate metric to determine the resources required for such efforts taken to achieve the growth in DPU and aligns the interests of the Manager with Unitholders. The Manager is motivated and driven to achieve DPU growth by ensuring the long- term sustainability of the assets through proactive asset management strategies and asset enhancement initiatives. The performance fee is paid annually, in compliance with the Property Funds Appendix.\n(iii) Acquisition fee and Divestment fee\nThese fees are essential to incentivise the Manager to continue to deliver long-term sustainable income to Unitholders, source for growth opportunities and yield-accretive acquisitions for AA REIT and to efficiently recycle capital through the divestment of under- performing or non-core assets. The Manager would have to carry out additional work as well as incur additional resources and time to source for various opportunities before a potential acquisition or divestment opportunity materialises into an eventuality. As such, the Manager should be fairly compensated for the efforts expended, costs incurred as well as time taken for such transactions.\n", "\n144\n145\n146\n149\n150\nFINANCIAL S TAT E M E N T S\n151\n153\n154\n161\n163\n\nReport of\nThe Trustee\n\nStatement by\nThe Manager\nIndependent Auditors\u2019 Report\n\nStatements of\nFinancial Position\n\nStatements of\nTotal Return\nDistribution Statements\n\nStatements of Movements\nin Unitholders\u2019 Funds\nPortfolio Statements\n\nConsolidated Statement\nof Cash Flows\n\nNotes to the\nFinancial Statements\n", "STATEMENT BY THE MANAGER\nYear ended 31 March 2023\nIn the opinion of the Directors of AIMS APAC REIT Management Limited (the \u201cManager\u201d), the accompanying financial statements set out on pages 149 to 219, comprising the statements of financial position, statements of total return, distribution statements, statements of movements in Unitholders\u2019 funds and portfolio statements of the Group and of the Trust, the consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group and notes to the financial statements are drawn up so as to present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and portfolio holdings of the Group and of the Trust as at 31 March 2023, and the total return, distributable income and movements in Unitholders\u2019 funds of the Group and of the Trust and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended in accordance with the recommendations of Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice 7 \u201cReporting Framework for Investment Funds\u201d issued by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and the provisions of the Trust Deed.

Details of Previous Share Purchases\nFor the period of 12 months immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date, the Company had not purchased or acquired any Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate.\n2.9. Listing Status\nThe Listing Manual requires a listed company to ensure that at least 10.0% of the total number of issued shares excluding treasury shares (excluding preference shares and convertible equity securities) in a class that is listed is at all times held by public shareholders.\nThe expression \u201cpublic\u201d is defined under the Listing Manual as persons other than (a) the directors, chief executive officer, substantial shareholders, or controlling shareholders of a company and its subsidiaries and (b) the associates (as defined in the Listing Manual) of the persons described in paragraph (a).\nAs at the Latest Practicable Date, there are 94,009,428 Shares in the hands of the public, representing 41.8% of the issued Shares of the Company (excluding 188,303 Shares held as treasury shares by the Company and subsidiary holdings as at the Latest Practicable Date). Assuming that the Company purchases its Shares through Market Purchases up to the full 10.0% limit pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate from the public on the Latest Practicable Date, the number of Shares in the hands of the public would be reduced to 71,522,150 Shares, representing 35.3% of the issued Shares of the Company (excluding 188,303 Shares held as treasury shares by the Company and subsidiary holdings as at the Latest Practicable Date).\nAccordingly, the Company is of the view that there is a sufficient number of Shares held by public shareholders which would permit the Company to undertake purchases or acquisitions of its Shares up to the full 10.0% limit pursuant to the proposed Share Buyback Mandate without affecting the listing status of the Shares on the SGX-ST, and that the number of Shares remaining in the hands of the public will not fall to such a level as to cause market illiquidity or to affect orderly trading.\n2.10.

Classification is una\ufb00ected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date (e.g. the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant).\nThe amendments also clarify what SFRS(I) 1-1 means when it refers to the \u2018settlement\u2019 of a liability. The amendments could a\ufb00ect the classification of liabilities, particularly for entities that previously considered management\u2019s intentions to determine classification and for some liabilities that can be converted into equity.\nThe Group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.\nAmendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes:\n\nDeferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (e\ufb00ective for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2023)\nThe amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes require companies to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary di\ufb00erences. They will typically apply to transactions such as leases of lessees and decommissioning obligations, and will require the recognition of additional deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe amendment should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, entities should recognise deferred tax assets (to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised) and deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of the earliest comparative period for all deductible and taxable temporary di\ufb00erences associated with:\n- right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and\n- decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities, and the corresponding amounts recognised as part of the cost of the related assets.\nThe cumulative e\ufb00ect of recognising these adjustments is recognised in retained earnings, or another component of equity, as appropriate.\nSFRS(I) 1-12 did not previously address how to account for the tax e\ufb00ects of on-balance sheet leases and similar transactions and various approaches were considered acceptable. Some entities may have already accounted for such transactions consistent with the new requirements. These entities will not be a\ufb00ected by the amendments.\nThe Group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.\n31.

There have been no changes in the Company\u2019s overall strategy from 2022.\nManagement monitors capital based on a gearing ratio and the gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity.

Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.\nThe Group has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liabilities of $503,000 (2022: $720,000).\nLeases as lessor\nThe Group leases out its investment property consisting of its owned commercial properties (see Note 4).

The Group has a system of controls in place to create an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks. The management continually monitors the Group\u2019s risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved.\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group\u2019s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit and Risk Management Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Management Committee.\n", "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT\u2019D)\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group\u2019s receivables from customers.\nThe Group\u2019s primary exposure to credit risk arises through its trade and other receivables and contract assets which relate mainly to amounts due from buyers of the Group\u2019s development properties. Settlement of such receivables is based on an agreed schedule in the sale and purchase agreements and the historical default rate has been low. Cash is placed with financial institutions with good credit rating.\nAt the reporting date, there was no significant concentration of credit risk for the Group. At the reporting date, the amounts due from subsidiaries of $1,125,176,000 (2022: $794,011,000) represent a significant portion of the Company\u2019s financial assets. Except as disclosed, there is no significant concentration of credit risk for the Company and the Group. The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represent the maximum credit exposure to credit risk, before taking into account any collateral held.\nTrade and other receivables and contract assets\nFor trade receivables and unbilled revenue from sale of development properties, the Group collects deposits from purchasers of the properties. If a purchaser defaults on payments, the Group may enforce payments via legal proceedings or if the purchaser is assessed to be insolvent, the Group may resume possession of the units, retain a portion of the purchaser\u2019s deposits from payments made to date, and resell the property.\nFor trade receivables from rental debtors, the Group typically collects deposits or banker\u2019s guarantees as collateral. Late payments (if any) are monitored closely.\nExposure to credit risk\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables and contract assets at the reporting date by business segment is set out below:\n\n | Group |  | Company\n2023   $\u2019000 |  | 2022   $\u2019000 | 2023   2022   $\u2019000   $\u2019000\n\nProperty development | 13,244 | 1,908 | \u2013 | \u2013\nHospitality | 551 | 580 | \u2013 | \u2013\nInvestment holding | 583 | 211 | 1,125,759 | 794,222\n | 14,378 | 2,699 | 1,125,759 | 794,222\nExpected credit loss assessment\nThe Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECL of trade receivables and contract assets from individual customers, which comprise a very large number of small balances.\nLoss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over the past 3 years (2022: 3 years). These rates are adjusted to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historic data has been collected, current conditions and the Group\u2019s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables. The exposure to credit risk and ECL for trade receivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is insignificant.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHRRJJJ_Bukit Sembawang Estates Limited_20230705172059_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [84, 87]}, {"question": "How does the Group subsequently measure all its equity instruments?", "answer": "The Group subsequently measures all its equity instruments at their fair values.", "raw_text": "How does the Group subsequently measure all its equity instruments?\n###ANSWER:\nThe Group subsequently measures all its equity instruments at their fair values.", "pages": ["Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n2.

Equity instruments are classified as FVPL with movements in their fair values recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the changes arise and presented in \u201cother gain/(loss)\u201d, except for those equity securities which are not held for trading.\nThe Group has elected to recognise changes in fair value of equity investments not held for trading in OCI as these are strategic investments and the Group considered this to be more relevant. Movements in fair values of investments classified as FVOCI are presented as \u201cfair value gain and losses\u201d in OCI. Dividends from equity investments are recognised in profit or loss as \u201cdividend income\u201d\n(b) Impairment\nThe Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt financial assets carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. Note 31(b) details how the Group determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\nFor trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by the SFRS(I) 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n(c) Recognition and derecognition\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date \u2013 the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.\nOn disposal of a debt instrument, the difference between the carrying amount and the sale proceeds is recognised in profit or loss. Any amount previously recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that asset is reclassified to profit or loss.\nOn disposal of an equity investment, the difference between the carrying amount and sales proceed is recognised in profit or loss if there was no election made to recognise fair value changes in other comprehensive income. If there was an election made, any difference between the carrying amount and sales proceed amount would be recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred to retained profits along with the amount previously recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that asset.\nTrade receivables that are factored out to banks and other financial institutions with recourse to the Group are not derecognised until the recourse period has expired and the risks and rewards of the receivables have been fully transferred. The corresponding cash received from the financial institutions is recorded as borrowings.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d)\n2.11 Derivative financial instruments\nA derivative financial instrument is initially recognised at its fair value on the date the contract is entered into and is subsequently carried at its fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\nFair value changes on derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss when the changes arise.\nThe Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategies for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives designated as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items.\nThe carrying amount of a derivative designated as a hedge is presented as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining expected life of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability if the remaining expected life of the hedged item is less than 12 months. The fair value of a trading derivative is presented as a current asset or liability.\n2.12 Borrowings\nBorrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting date, in which case they are presented as non-current liabilities.\nBorrowings are initially recognised at fair value (net of transaction costs) and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.\n2.13 Borrowing costs\nBorrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method except for those costs that are directly attributable to the construction or development of properties and assets under construction. This includes those costs on borrowings acquired specifically for the construction or development of properties and assets under construction, as well as those in relation to general borrowings used to finance the construction or development of properties and assets under construction.\nThe actual borrowing costs incurred during the period up to the issuance of the temporary occupation permit less any investment income on temporary investment of these borrowings, are capitalised in the cost of the property under development.\n", "Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d)\n2.14 Financial guarantees\nThe Company issues corporate guarantees to banks for bank borrowings if required. These guarantees are financial guarantees as they require the Company to reimburse the banks if the borrower fails to make principal or interest payments when due in accordance with the terms of their borrowings. Intra-Group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\nFinancial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at the higher of:\n(a)\n\namount initially recognised less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles\nof SFRS(I) 15; and\n(b) the amount of expected loss allowance computed using the impairment methodology under SFRS(I) 9.\n2.15 Trade and other payables\nTrade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year which are unpaid. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). Otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities.\nTrade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n2.16 Fair value estimation of financial assets and liabilities\nThe fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions based on market conditions that are existing at each balance sheet date. Where appropriate, quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used. Valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis are also used to determine the fair values of the financial instruments.\nThe carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost approximate their fair values.\n2.17 Offsetting financial instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHROF7U_Boustead Projects Limited_20230705072347_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [99, 102]}, {"question": "What is the total number of shares on issue and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange?", "answer": "406,153,457", "raw_text": "What is the total number of shares on issue and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange?\n###ANSWER:\n406,153,457", "pages": ["Shareholder Information.\nAs at 21 August 2023.\n4.

Industry analysts indicate that inventory levels remain high across the value chain, which may result in industry revenues remaining weak for a short period until inventory levels are lower. Longer term trends remain, such as more products and services requiring increasing amounts of embedded intelligence, and so the semiconductor industry is expected to return to growth.\nThe industry is vulnerable to other external factors, including trade disputes and their\nassociated sanctions against specific companies, supply-chain disruption, as well as the impact of temporary component shortages. If shipments of electronic devices weaken, it may lead to lower technology royalty revenue, and if Arm\u2019s customers facing reduced revenues choose to delay licensing decisions, it may lead to lower technology non-royalty revenue. However, it is difficult to anticipate when these events may occur and the impact on the semiconductor industry in general or Arm specifically.\nArm is expecting that, as consumer and enterprise electronics become more advanced, its\ntechnology will be further utilized and opportunities will expand over the long term.\nFinancial results\nNet sales in U.S. dollars\nNet sales in this section are presented in U.S. dollars as Arm\u2019s revenue is primarily based on U.S. dollars.\n\n |  |  | (Millions of U.S. dollars)\n | Fiscal 2021 | Fiscal 2022 | Change   Change %\nTechnology royalty | 1,536 | 1,783 | 247   16.1%\nTechnology non-royalty | 1,129 | 1,034 | (95)   (8.5%)\nTotal net sales | 2,665 | 2,817 | 152   5.7%\nNet sales increased by $152 million (5.7%) year on year due to strong growth in technology\nroyalty revenue, partially offset by a decrease in technology non-royalty revenue.\n", "Technology royalty revenue\nTechnology royalty revenue increased by $247 million (16.1%) year on year. Royalty revenues were driven by the deployment of Arm-based networking equipment into 5G base stations, strong shipments of Arm-based 5G high-end smartphones, including some based on Arm\u2019s latest Armv9 architecture, which will typically command a higher royalty fee, and Arm\u2019s customers gaining share in multiple markets, such as automotive, IoT, and servers. In addition, Arm\u2019s customers have benefitted from the high demand for computer chips, which enabled prices to increase. As Arm\u2019s royalty revenue is often based on the price of the chips, Arm also benefitted from higher chip prices.\nTechnology non-royalty revenue\nTechnology non-royalty revenue decreased by $95 million (8.5%) year on year. This decrease is primarily due to high technology non-royalty revenue in the previous fiscal year, which was due in part to the timing of revenue related to contracts signed with some large customers who were making major investments in Arm\u2019s expanded technology portfolio. Arm continued to see robust customer demand for its products in the fourth quarter with technology non-royalty revenue increasing by 18.1% year on year.\nFollowing the acquisition by the Company, Arm increased investment in R&D, which expanded\nArm\u2019s product portfolio to include processors optimized for servers, automotive electronics, and AI acceleration. This led to a wider range of customers licensing Arm technology, as well as existing customers having more Arm technology to choose from, both of which helped to drive\nlicensing revenues. This included licenses for processors used by customers intending to build Arm-based servers and PC chips, smartphones, networking equipment, autonomous systems, such as industrial robotics and self-driving vehicles, and for AI-enabled microcontrollers.\nSegment income\nSegment income on a U.S. dollar basis stayed flat year on year due to an increase in expenses related to a stock compensation scheme and professional fees related to preparations for the proposed initial public offering despite higher net sales and the improved operational efficiency. In yen terms, segment income increased by \u00a57,463 million (18.1%) year on year to \u00a548,663 million, due to the weaker yen exchange rate used for translations in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230727OTHR83M2_Softbank Group Corp._20230727161723_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [9, 12]}, {"question": "What is the estimated useful life of Freehold office premises?", "answer": "50 years", "raw_text": "What is the estimated useful life of Freehold office premises?\n###ANSWER:\n50 years", "pages": ["NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT\u2019D)\nThe accounting policies of the subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.\nLoss of control\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.\nTransactions eliminated on consolidation\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nSubsidiaries in the separate financial statements\nInvestments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company\u2019s statement of financial position at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS \u2013 The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group.\nThe Group measures goodwill at the date of acquisition as:\nthe fair value of the consideration transferred; plus l\nthe recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus l\nif the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree, l\nover the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.\nWhen the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nThe consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included in the consideration transferred. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\nChanges in the Group\u2019s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.\n", "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT\u2019D)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION \u2013 Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year.\nINVESTMENT PROPERTY \u2013 Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or capital appreciation or both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes.\nInvestment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. The cost of self-constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs.\nDepreciation on investment property is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of the investment property.\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\nFreehold office premises | 50 years\nFurniture and fittings | 5 years\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT \u2013 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss where the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to be lower than its carrying amount.\nRecognition and measurement\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes:\nthe cost of materials and direct labour; l\n\nany other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their\nintended use;\nl\nwhen the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located; and l\ncapitalised borrowing costs. l\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss.\n", "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT\u2019D)\nSubsequent costs\nThe cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.\nDepreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment. Renovation in-progress is not depreciated.\nDepreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\nFreehold properties | 50 years\nRight-of-use assets | 2 to 9 years\nFurniture, fittings and equipment | 5 to 10 years\nPlant and machinery | 5 to 10 years\nMotor vehicles | 5 years\nComputers | 3 years\nResidual values are ascribed to the core component of the freehold properties which takes into consideration the freehold tenure of the site on which the properties are located.\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date.\nLEASES \u2013 Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\nRental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\nWhen a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from\nContracts with Customers to allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.\nAs a lessee, the Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHRRJJJ_Bukit Sembawang Estates Limited_20230705172059_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [54, 57]}, {"question": "What is the total amount of the Group's non-derivative financial liabilities that will mature in less than 1 year as of 31 March 2023?", "answer": "S$15,661,000", "raw_text": "What is the total amount of the Group's non-derivative financial liabilities that will mature in less than 1 year as of 31 March 2023?\n###ANSWER:\nS$15,661,000", "pages": ["Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n32 Financial Instruments (cont\u2019d)\n(a) Financial risk management (cont\u2019d)\ni.

If any such indication exists, the asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated.\nIf it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, then the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs will be identified.\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level.\nAll individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAn impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset\u2019s or cash-generating unit\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value-in-use, based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.\nAll assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.\nAny impairment loss is charged to profit or loss, unless it reverses a previous revaluation in which case it is charged to equity.\nAn impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n", "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2(d) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT\u2019D)\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the rendering of services, net of goods and services tax, rebates and discounts.\nRevenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.\nRevenue from provision of services is recognised when the services are rendered.\nInterest income is recognised on a time-apportionment basis using the effective interest method.\nGovernment grants\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group and the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.\nGovernment grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group and the Company recognise as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group and the Company with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.\nFunctional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (\u201cfunctional currency\u201d). The financial statements of the Group and the Company are presented in United States dollars, which is also the functional currency of the Company.\nConversion of foreign currencies\nTransactions and balances\nTransactions in a currency other than the functional currency (\u201cforeign currency\u201d) are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Currency translation differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing rates at the reporting date are recognised in profit or loss.\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of or any borrowings forming part of the net investment of the foreign operation are repaid, a proportionate share of the accumulated translation differences is reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\nForeign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either other income or other operating expense depending on whether foreign currency movements are in the net gain or net loss position.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230929OTHR5CH1_Jasper Investments Limited_20230929070109_00_AR_4Q_20220331.3.pdf", "page_number": [3, 6]}, {"question": "When was Japan Foods Holding Ltd. established?", "answer": "1997", "raw_text": "When was Japan Foods Holding Ltd. established?\n###ANSWER:\n1997", "pages": ["", "TA B LE OF\nCONT ENTS\n01 CORPORATE PROFILE\n02 AT A GLANCE\n04 OUR BRANDS\n08 CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n09 CHAIRMAN\u2019S MESSAGE\n12 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n16\n\nOPERATING AND\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\n20 BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n22 KEY MANAGEMENT\n24 CORPORATE INFORMATION\n25 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\nThis annual report has been reviewed by the Company\u2019s sponsor, UOB Kay Hian\n\nPrivate Limited (\u201cSponsor\u201d) for compliance   with the relevant rules of the Singapore   Exchange Securities Trading Limited (\u201cSGX-   ST\u201d) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist.

Constantly evolving with changing consumer tastes, Japan Foods has successfully expanded its restaurant portfolio to encompass both franchised and self-developed Japanese concept brands.\nTo widen its customer reach, the Group launched its first Japanese Halal concept restaurant called \u201cTokyo Shokudo\u201d in 2020. Since then, it has penetrated deeper into the \u201cno pork, no lard\u201d market segment with the launch of new self-developed brands such as \u201cYakiniku Shokudo\u201d and \u201cEdo Shokudo\u201d.\nRegionally, the Group\u2019s network extends beyond Singapore to include a restaurant in Malaysia under a sub-franchise agreement and restaurants in Hong Kong, China and Indonesia operated by associate companies. Japan Foods has a joint venture company with Minor Food Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cMinor Singapore\u201d) called Dining Collective Pte. Ltd., which was formed to conduct the business of franchising and operating existing restaurant brands owned by the Group and Minor Singapore in Thailand, Japan and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nFor its efforts in corporate governance, Japan Foods was named the \u201cMost Transparent Company (Catalist)\u201d at the 17 2016 and also awarded the \u201cTransparency Award \u2013 SMEs\u201d at the 18 Investors\u2019 Choice Awards 2017. In July 2018, the Group received the \u201cBest Managed Board Award (Gold)\u201d at the Singapore Corporate Awards 2018 and in September 2018, it was named Runner-Up in the \u201cMost Transparent Company \u2013 Hotel / Restaurant\u201d award category at the 19 2018.

The Management provides the Directors with complete, adequate and timely information prior to meetings and on an ongoing basis to enable them to make informed decisions and discharge their duties and responsibilities. The Company also has an ongoing budget for all Directors to attend appropriate courses, conferences and seminars for them to stay abreast of relevant business developments and outlook. The Board as a whole is updated regularly on changes to the Listing Rules and the Code, as well as on risk management, corporate governance, insider trading and the key changes in the relevant regulatory requirements and international financial reporting standards and the relevant laws and regulations to facilitate effective discharge of their fiduciary duties as Board or Board Committees members.\nThe Company recognises the importance of appropriate training for its Directors. All newly appointed Directors will be given an orientation on the Group\u2019s business strategies and operations, as well as extensive information about the Company\u2019s history, mission and values. Where relevant, training would be provided which includes areas such as accounting, legal and industry-specific knowledge where appropriate. The Company will arrange for any new director with no prior experience of serving as a director in a listed company to attend appropriate courses, conferences or seminars, at the expense of the Company to enable him/her to discharge his/her duties effectively. Newly appointed Directors will be provided with a formal letter setting out their duties and obligations.\nThe Company encourages existing Directors to attend relevant training courses, particularly on relevant new laws, regulations and changing commercial risks which have an important bearing on the Company and the Directors\u2019 obligations towards the Company. During FY2023, the Directors attended relevant courses and received updates on regulatory changes to the Catalist Rules and changes to the accounting standards relevant to the Group. The Board has participated in compulsory sustainability training in line with SGX\u2019s updated requirements. One of the directors has not completed sustainability training due to unforeseen circumstances. Nevertheless, the director has signed up for upcoming training which will be held on 12 October 2023.\nThe Directors, either collectively or individually have separate and independent access to the Management, the company secretary, and external advisers (where necessary) at the company\u2019s expense. The appointment and removal of the company secretary(ies) are subject to the Board\u2019s approval.\n", "Corporate Governance Report\nPrinciple 2: Board Composition and Guidance\nAs at the date of this report, the Board had four members, comprising three Independent Directors making up the majority of the Board, as follows:\n\nDato\u2019 Terence Tea Yeok Kian\t\t | Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nMr Cheong Keng Chuan, Alfred\t\t | Lead Independent Director\nMr Ng Siew Hoong, Linus\t\t | Independent Director\nMr Levin Lee Keng Weng\t\t | Independent Director\nThe Board considers an \u201cIndependent Director\u201d as one who has no relationship with the Company, its related companies, its substantial shareholders of not less than 5% of the total votes attached to all voting shares (excluding treasury shares) in the Company, or its officers that could interfere or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Director\u2019s independent business judgement in carrying out the functions as an independent director with a view to the best interests of the Group.\nThe independence of each Director is assessed and reviewed annually by the Board through the NC. The NC adopts the Code\u2019s definition of independence in its review. Each Independent Director is required to complete a Director\u2019s independence checklist annually to confirm his independence based on the provisions as set out in the Code. Based on the respective confirmations and results of the NC\u2019s review, the NC is satisfied that the Independent Directors comply with Provision 2.1 of the Code.\nThe Board noted that there should be a strong and independent element on the Board to exercise objective judgement on corporate affairs independently. Currently, the Board comprises four (4) directors, of whom three (3) are independent and one (1) is non-independent. In view of this, the Company is in compliance with Provisions 2.2 and 2.3 of the Code that the Independent Directors make up a majority of the Board.\nThe Board and its Board Committees comprises of Directors who as a group provide an appropriate balance and diversity of skills, experience, and knowledge of the Company and the Group with core competencies in accounting, legal framework, business experience, and industry knowledge. At meetings of the Board and Board Committees, the Independent Directors endeavour to constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and to review the performance of Management in meeting goals and objectives. Key issues and strategies, and challenges arising from the changes in the evolving competitive landscape are critically examined, taking into consideration the long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders. To facilitate a more effective check on Management and Independent Directors, led by the Lead Independent Director may meet without the presence of Management, and the Lead Independent Director will provide feedback to the Board and/or Chairman as appropriate.\nThe Board noted that gender diversity on the Board is also one of the recommendations under the Code to provide an appropriate balance and diversity. Although there is currently no female Director appointed to the Board, the Board shall consider the possibility of appointing a female Director if a suitable candidate is nominated.\nNotwithstanding that the Company has not adopted a formal board diversity policy, the Company recognises and embraces the importance and benefits of having a diverse Board to enhance the quality of its performance. In reviewing the appointments to the board and the continuation of these appointments, the Board together with the Nominating Committee takes into consideration factors including skills, core competencies, knowledge, professional experience, educational background, gender, age and length of service into account in the selection and appointment of Directors, to ensure that the Board and Board Committees are of an appropriate size, and comprise directors who as a group provide the appropriate balance, mix of skills, knowledge, experience, and other aspects of diversity such as gender and age, to avoid groupthink, foster constructive debate and to function effectively to make informed decisions overseeing the Group\u2019s business.\nWith the introduction of Rule 710(A) of the Catalist Rules effective from 1 January 2022, the Board will endeavour to formalise a board diversity policy that addresses gender, skills and experience and any other relevant aspect of diversity and describe such policy in its Annual Report for the financial year ending 31 March 2024.\nThe Independent Directors are encouraged to meet periodically without the presence of the Management. The Chairman of such meetings will provide feedback to the Board and/or Chief Executive Officer as appropriate.\nThere is no Independent Director who has served on the Board beyond nine years from the date of his first appointment. Key information of Directors are set out in pages 9 to 12 of this Annual Report.\n", "\nCorporate Governance Report\nPrinciple 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThe Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company is Dato\u2019 Terence Tea Yeok Kian (\u201cDato\u2019 Tea\u201d), who leads the Board and is responsible for the effective working of the Board. The Board is of the view that accountability and independence have not been compromised despite the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer being the same person. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer have defined responsibilities which, during his tenure so far, have not conflicted with each other. Major business proposals are discussed at Board meetings before decisions are made.\nThe Board believes there is a sufficient element of independence and adequate safeguards against a concentration of power in one single person. As the Chairman, Dato\u2019 Tea\u2019s responsibilities, among others, include the following:\n\nscheduling meetings and leading the Board to ensure its effectiveness and approving the agenda of Board meetings in\nconsultation with Management;\n\uf097\n\n\uf097 | reviewing key proposals and Board papers before they are presented to the Board and ensuring that Board members are   provided with accurate and timely information;\n\uf097 | ensuring that Board members engage Management in constructive debate on various matters including strategic issues and   business planning processes;\n\n\uf097 | promoting a high standard of corporate governance; and\n\uf097 | ensure effective communication with shareholders.\nThe Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the operations and oversees the day-to-day management of the business operations. He is instrumental in formulating strategies, business development, goals and performance targets and ensuring objectives are met.\nPursuant to Provision 3.3 of the Code, as the Chairman is non-independent, the Board has appointed Mr Cheong Keng Chuan, Alfred as the Lead Independent Director and is of the view that there is a sufficiently strong independent element on the Board to enable the independent exercise of objective judgement on corporate affairs of the Group by members of the Board, taking into account factors such as the number of Independent Directors on the Board, as well as the size and scope of the affairs and operations of the Group.\nThe Lead Independent Director is available to shareholders where they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has failed to resolve or for which such contact is not appropriate.\nBOARD COMMITTEES\nNominating Committee\n\nPrinciple 4: Board Membership\nPrinciple 5: Board Performance\nAs at the date of this report, the NC comprises four members, three of whom (including the NC Chairman) are independent directors.

Such Shareholder need not abstain from voting in respect of the resolution authorising the proposed renewal of the Share Buyback Mandate unless so required under the Act.\nShareholders who are in doubt as to their obligations, if any, to make a mandatory takeover offer under the Code as a result of Share Buybacks by the Company are advised to consult their professional advisers and/or the SIC and/or other relevant authorities at the earliest opportunity.\n(d) Conditions for Exemption from making a General Offer under Rule 14 of the Code\nPursuant to Section 3(a) of Appendix 2 of the Code, Directors and their concert parties will be exempted from the requirement to make a general offer under Rule 14 of the Code as a result of any Share Buyback carried out pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate, subject to the following conditions:\n(i) this Appendix seeking Shareholders\u2019 approval for the renewal of the Share Buyback Mandate contains advice to the effect that by voting in favour of the proposed renewal of the Share Buyback Mandate, Shareholders are waiving their rights to a general offer at the required price from the Directors and their concert parties, who, as a result of the Company buying back its Shares, would increase their voting rights to 30% or more, or, if they hold between 30% and 50% of the Company\u2019s voting rights, would increase their voting rights by more than 1% in any six (6) months period.

However, any increase in the percentage voting rights as a result of the buyback under the Share Buyback Mandate will be taken into account together with any voting rights acquired by the Directors and their concert parties (by whatever means) in determining whether the Directors and their concert parties have increased their aggregate voting rights in the Company by more than one percent (1%) in any six (6) months period.\n(e) Application of the Code\nAs at the Latest Practicable Date, MTBL Global Fund (which is a Substantial Shareholder) holds 34,462,956 Shares representing approximately 39.58% of the voting rights of the Company and MTBL Global Holdings Pte. Ltd. (which is a Substantial Shareholder) holds 10,250,000 Shares representing approximately 11.77% of the voting rights of the Company. As Mr. Sun Quan (who is a Director of the Company) has a controlling interest in the fund manager of MTBL Global Fund and is the sole shareholder and director of MTBL Global Holdings Pte. Ltd., he is deemed interested in the Shares held by MTBL Global Fund and MTBL Global Holdings Pte. Ltd. Accordingly, Mr. Sun Quan is deemed interested in approximately 39.58% of the voting rights of the Company held by MTBL Global Fund and 11.77% of the voting rights of the Company held by MTBL Global Holdings Pte. Ltd. Mr. Sun Quan is the indirect sole shareholder of Capital Impetus Group Limited.\nBased on the interests of the Affected Parties as at the Latest Practicable Date, and assuming that:\n(A)\n\nthere is no change in the shareholdings of each of the Affected Parties between the\nLatest Practicable Date and the Approval Date; and\n", "\nLETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n(B) no further Shares are issued by the Company on or prior to the Approval Date,\nthe purchase or acquisition by the Company of the maximum limit of 10% of its issued Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date will result in the following:\n(1) the voting rights of MTBL Global Fund in the Company will increase from approximately 39.58% 1 2 to 43.98% ;\n(2) the voting rights of MTBL Global Holdings Pte. Ltd. in the Company will increase from approximately 11.77% 2 3 to 13.08% ; and\n(3) due to Mr. Sun Quan\u2019s deemed interest in the Shares held by MTBL Global Fund and MTBL Global Holdings Pte.

Tax Implications\nShareholders who are in doubt as to their respective tax positions or any tax implications, or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction outside Singapore, should consult their own professional advisers.\n3. FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE SHARE BUYBACKS\nIt is not possible for the Company to realistically calculate or quantify the financial effects of Share Buybacks made pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate as the resultant effect would depend on, inter alia, the number of Shares purchased or acquired, the price paid for such Shares and the manner in which the purchase or acquisition is funded.\nUnder the Act, any purchase or acquisition of Shares may only be made out of the Company\u2019s capital or profits so long as the Company is solvent. Where the consideration paid by the Company for a Share Buyback is made out of profits, such consideration (excluding related brokerage, goods and services tax, stamp duties and other related expenses) will correspondingly reduce the amount available for the distribution of cash dividends by the Company. Where the consideration paid by the Company for a Share Buyback is made out of capital, the amount available for the distribution of cash dividends by the Company will not be reduced.\n1 Based on the issued share capital of the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date, being 87,072,231 Shares (excluding treasury\nshares).\nBased on the issued share capital of the Company comprising 78,365,008 Shares, following Share Buyback of 10% of the issued\nShares as at the Latest Practicable Date.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230712OTHR7I94_Ascent Bridge Limited_20230712220939_00_AR_4Q_20230331.3.pdf", "page_number": [6, 9]}, {"question": "What is the mission of Boustead Projects Limited?", "answer": "To provide technology-driven design, engineering and delivery of end-to-end smart, eco-sustainable and future-ready real estate solutions that can be deployed in any sector and market.", "raw_text": "What is the mission of Boustead Projects Limited?\n###ANSWER:\nTo provide technology-driven design, engineering and delivery of end-to-end smart, eco-sustainable and future-ready real estate solutions that can be deployed in any sector and market.", "pages": ["Corporate Governance\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT\n\nShareholder Rights and Conduct of General Meetings\nPrinciple 11 - The company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably in order to enable them to exercise shareholders\u2019 rights\nand have the opportunity to communicate their views on matters affecting the company.

Specifically, each shareholder is allowed to appoint up to two proxies to attend and vote at general meetings on his/her behalf, unless the shareholder is a relevant intermediary (as defined in Section 181 of the Companies Act 1967). A shareholder which is a relevant intermediary is entitled to appoint more than two proxies, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by such shareholder. A \u201crelevant intermediary\u201d includes corporations holding licences in providing nominee and custodial services and the Central Provident Fund Board (\u201cCPF\u201d) where it purchases shares on behalf of the CPF investors.\nArticle 77A of the Company\u2019s Constitution also allows the Board to approve and implement, subject to such security measures as may be deemed necessary or expedient, such voting methods to allow shareholders who are unable to vote in person at any general meeting, the option to vote in absentia, including but not limited to voting by mail, electronic mail or facsimile. The Company has not implemented voting in absentia by mail, electronic mail or facsimile due to concerns relating to the authentication of shareholder identity and other related security and integrity issues.\nTo safeguard shareholders\u2019 interest, separate resolution is proposed on each substantially separate issue at the general meetings of shareholders, unless the issues are interdependent and linked so as to form one single proposal. All the resolutions at general meetings are in single item resolutions. Where the resolutions are combined, the Company will explain the reasons and material implications in the notice of meeting. Detailed information of the resolutions is provided in the explanatory notes to the Notice of AGM in the Annual Report.\nAll resolutions at general meetings of the Company are voted by poll as required by Rule 730A(2) of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST. The detailed results of the electronic poll voting on each resolution tabled at general meetings, including the total number of votes \u201cfor\u201d, \u201cagainst\u201d or \u201cabstain\u201d in relation to each resolution tabled, are announced immediately at the general meetings and via SGXNET thereafter.\nShareholders are given the opportunity to raise questions and clarify any issues that they may have relating to the resolutions to be passed. The Board and senior management are present at each general meeting to respond to any questions from shareholders. The Group\u2019s external auditors are also present to address queries regarding the conduct of the audit and the preparation and content of the auditors\u2019 report.

There is no asymmetrical allocation to reportable segments. Management evaluates performance on the basis of profit or loss from operation before tax expense.\nManagement considers the business from both business and geographical segment perspective. The Group\u2019s reportable segments are strategic business units that are organised based on their function and targeted customer groups. They are managed separately because each business unit requires di\ufb00erent skill sets and marketing strategies. There is no change from prior periods in the measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss.\nIncome taxes are managed by the management of respective entities within the Group.\nThe Group accounts for inter\u2013segment sales and transfer as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, which approximate market prices. These intersegment transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\nBusiness segments\nThe Group is organised into five main business segments:\nInfrastructure development and turnkey construction; \uf06c\nProperty development; \uf06c\nGas distribution, including revenue from service concession (which arose from construction) (Note 2.4); \uf06c\nElectronics and trading; and \uf06c\nInvestment securities trading. \uf06c\nOther operations of the Group mainly comprise investment holding and other management services, neither of which constitutes a separately reportable segment.\nSegment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, development property, deferred tax assets, inventories, receivables, financial assets and operating cash and bank deposits. Segment liabilities comprise payables, provisions, borrowings and deferred tax liabilities. Capital expenditures comprise additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including those acquired through business combinations.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230914OTHR4L0W_Renaissance United Limited_20230914201416_00_AR_4Q_20230430.1.pdf", "page_number": [12, 15]}, {"question": "What is the maximum number of shares that can be issued pursuant to the Resolution?", "answer": "50% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings)", "raw_text": "What is the maximum number of shares that can be issued pursuant to the Resolution?\n###ANSWER: 50% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings)", "pages": ["(ii) make or grant offers, agreements or options (collectively, \u201cInstruments\u201d) that might or would require shares to be issued, including but not limited to the creation and issue of (as well as adjustments to) warrants, debentures or other instruments convertible into shares,\n\nat any time and upon such terms and conditions and for such\npurposes and to such persons as the directors may in their\nabsolute discretion deem fit; and\n(b) (notwithstanding the authority conferred by this Resolution may have ceased to be in force) issue shares in pursuance of any Instrument made or granted by the directors while this Resolution was in force,\nprovided that:\n(1) the aggregate number of shares to be issued pursuant to this Resolution (including shares to be issued in pursuance of Instruments made or granted pursuant to this Resolution) does not exceed 50% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) (as calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) below), of which the aggregate number of shares to be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders of the Company (including shares to be issued in pursuance of Instruments made or granted pursuant to this Resolution) does not exceed 10% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) (as calculated in accordance with sub- paragraph (2) below);\n(2) (subject to such manner of calculation as may be prescribed by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (\u201cSGX-ST\u201d)) for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares that may be issued under sub-paragraph (1) above, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) at the time this Resolution is passed, after adjusting for:\n(i)\n\nnew shares arising from the conversion or exercise of\nany convertible securities or share options or vesting of\nshare awards which were issued and are outstanding or\nsubsisting at the time this Resolution is passed; and\n(ii) any subsequent bonus issue or consolidation or sub-division of shares,\nand, in sub-paragraph (1) above and this sub-paragraph (2), \u201csubsidiary holdings\u201d has the meaning given to it in the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST;\n(3) in exercising the authority conferred by this Resolution, the Company shall comply with the provisions of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST for the time being in force (unless such compliance has been waived by the SGX-ST) and the Constitution for the time being of the Company; and\n", "\n\n(4) | (unless revoked or varied by the Company in general meeting)   the authority conferred by this Resolution shall continue in force   until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the   Company or the date by which the next Annual General Meeting   of the Company is required by law to be held, whichever is the | \n | earlier. | (Ordinary Resolution 6)\nProposed Renewal of the Shareholders Mandate for Interested Person Transactions\n7.

This was mainly due to the decreases of professional legal fees for the legal case with Ahmad Zaki Sdn Bhd, of approximately RM0.09 million in FY2023 (FY2022: approximately RM0.13 million). For more information on the legal case, please refer to the Company\u2019s announcement dated 9 May 2023.\nADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nAdministrative expenses increased by approximately RM2.72 million or approximately 46.8% from approximately RM5.80 million in FY2022 to approximately RM8.52 million in FY2023. This was mainly due to the increase of (i) staff costs of approximately RM0.83 million; (ii) levy expenses for foreign employees of approximately RM0.29 million; (iii) professional fees incurred for the disposal of property of approximately RM1.40 million; and (iv) depreciation of right-of-use assets relating to the leaseback of property, which commenced during FY2023, of approximately RM0.27 million (FY2022: Nil), partially offset against consultancy fees of approximately RM0.01 million (FY2022: approximately RM0.08 million).\nOTHER LOSSES\nOther losses increased by approximately RM0.52 million or approximately 18.7% from approximately RM2.80 million in FY2022 to approximately RM3.32 million in FY2023 mainly due to increase of (i) plant and equipment written off of approximately RM1.76 million mainly due to unsuccessful completion of capital work-in-progress (FY2022: approximately RM0.06 million); and (ii) realised and unrealised foreign exchange loss of approximately RM0.18 million and RM0.39 million respectively in FY2023, due to weakening of Malaysia ringgit against foreign currencies as well as foreign currency translation loss due to the payment of dividends by the Company in Singapore dollars (FY2022: Nil); partially offset against allowance for impairment on trade receivables of approximately RM0.15 million as lesser allowance for impairment on trade receivables was recorded for FY2023 (FY2022: approximately RM1.46 million) and absence of allowance for impairment on associates (FY2022: approximately RM0.44 million).\nFINANCE COSTS\nFinance costs increased from approximately RM0.15 million in FY2022 to approximately RM0.21 million in FY2023 due to increase in interest of lease liability of approximately RM0.08 million (FY2022: Nil), partially offset against decrease in interest of bankers\u2019 acceptance of approximately RM0.07 million in FY2023 (FY2022: approximately RM0.09 million).\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE\nIncome tax expense comprises current income tax expense, under provision for taxation in prior years and deferred tax adjustments. Provision of current year taxation amounted to RM0.05 million provided for in FY2023 while RM0.01 million was provided for in FY2022. Under provision of taxation in FY2023 was RM0.01 million while FY2022 was RM0.03 million.

For this purpose, pursuant to the Act, a company is solvent if at the date of the payment the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a) there is no ground on which the company could be found to be unable to pay its debts;\n(b) if:\n(i) it is intended to commence winding up of the company within the period of 12 months immediately after the date of the payment, the company will be able to pay its debts in full within the period of 12 months after the date of commencement of the winding up; or\n(ii) it is not intended so to commence winding up, the company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due during the period of 12 months immediately after the date of the payment; and\n(c) the value of the company\u2019s assets is not less than the value of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and will not, after the proposed purchase, acquisition, variation or release (as the case may be), become less than the value of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities).\nThe Company will use internal resources or external borrowings or a combination of both to fund purchases of Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate.

The Directors will only make purchases or acquisitions pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate in circumstances which they believe will not result in any material adverse effect to the financial position of the Company or the Group.\n", "\nLETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n2.8. Listing Rules\n(a) Reporting requirements\nRule 886 of the Listing Rules provides that a listed company shall notify the SGX-ST of any Share Buyback as follows:\n(i) in the case of a Market Purchase, by 9.00 a.m. on the Market Day following the day on which it purchased Shares; and\n(ii) in the case of an Off-Market Purchase under an equal access scheme, by 9.00 a.m. on the second Market Day after the close of acceptances of the offer.\nThe notification of such Share Buybacks to the SGX-ST shall be in such form and shall include such details as the SGX-ST may prescribe, such as the total number of Shares purchased, the purchase price per Share or the highest and lowest prices paid for such Shares, as applicable.\n(b) Insider trading\nWhile the Listing Rules do not expressly prohibit any purchase of shares by a listed company during any particular time or times, because a listed company would be regarded as an \u201cinsider\u201d in relation to any proposed purchase or acquisition of its shares, the Company will not undertake any purchase or acquisition of its Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate at any time after a price sensitive matter or development has occurred or has been the subject of a decision until the price sensitive information has been announced. In particular, in line with the best practices on securities dealings stated in Rule 1207(19) of the Listing Manual, the Company will not purchase or acquire any Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate during the period commencing two weeks immediately preceding the announcement of the Company\u2019s first three quarterly results or one month immediately preceding the announcement of the Company\u2019s half year or full year results, as the case may be.\n(c) Listing status\nUnder the Listing Rules, the Company is required to ensure that at least 10% of its shares excluding treasury shares (excluding preference shares and convertible equity securities) are at all times held by the public.\nAs at the Latest Practicable Date, 41,225,075 Shares representing approximately 47.35% of the Company\u2019s Shares are held in the hands of the public. In undertaking any purchase of its Shares through Market Purchases, the Directors will use their best efforts to ensure a sufficient number of Shares remain in the hands of the public so that the Share Buybacks will not:\n(i) adversely affect the listing status of the Shares on the SGX-ST;\n(ii) cause market illiquidity; or\n(iii) adversely affect the orderly trading of the Shares.\n2.9. Reporting requirements under the Act\nWithin 30 days of passing of the Shareholders\u2019 resolution to approve the purchase of Shares by the Company, the Company shall lodge a copy of such resolution with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore (\u201cACRA\u201d).\n", "LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\nThe Company shall notify ACRA within 30 days of a purchase or acquisition of Shares on the SGX- ST or otherwise.

The Company has implemented a large number of safe management measures \u2013 in line with or exceeding Singapore Government-advised levels \u2013 which have been detailed in the past FY2021 and FY2022 Longevity Reports (Sustainability Report).\nWhile most of these safe management measures have been relaxed after COVID-19 reached the endemic phase, the Company continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation and the Company\u2019s Human Resources department will update employees and implement such safe management measures as may be issued by the government from time to time.\nRecognition\nSince November 2019, the Company continues to be in the SGX Fast Track Programme, which recognises the Company for its high corporate governance standards and good compliance track record, with prioritised clearance for the Company\u2019s corporate action submissions.\n", "16 Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\n\nGroup at a Glance\nSocio-Economic & Sustainability Performance\n\u201cNot all profit is equal.

The Board has established the Audit and Risk Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d), which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group\u2019s risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.\nRisk management is integral to the whole business of the Group. The Group has a system of controls in place to create an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks. The management continually monitors the Group\u2019s risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group\u2019s activities.\nThe Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group\u2019s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The function of the Committee is set out in the Corporate Governance Report.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group\u2019s trade and other receivables and contract assets.\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets and contract assets represent the maximum credit exposure to credit risk.\n", "\n\nSAPPHIRE CORPORATION LIMITED 120\nANNUAL REPORT 2022\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nCredit risk (Continued)\nTrade and other receivables\nImpairment losses on financial assets recognised in the statement of comprehensive income were as follows:\n\n | RMB\u2019000 | RMB\u2019000\nThe Group\n\nImpairment loss on trade and other receivables | \u2013 | 17\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group\u2019s customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk. Details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 28.\nThe Group has a credit policy in place which establishes credit limits for customers and monitors their balances on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.\nAll of the Group\u2019s customers are in PRC.\nThe Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables. The Group does not have trade and other receivable and contract assets for which no loss allowance is recognised because of collateral.\nExposure to credit risk\nThe exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments and other tax recoverable) and contract assets at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows:\n\n | The Group |  | The Company\n2022 |  | 2021 | 2022   2021\n\n | RMB\u2019000 | RMB\u2019000 | RMB\u2019000 | RMB\u2019000\nSingapore | 289 | 174 | 289 | 174\nChina | 83,981 | 54,263 | \u2013 | \u2013\n | 84,270 | 54,437 | 289 | 174\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group has concentration of credit risk on the outstanding trade receivables due from Ranken Group amounting to RMB51.1 million or 89% (2021 \u2013 RMB43.7 million or 88%) of the Group\u2019s trade receivables (refer to Note 8). As at the date of this report, approximately RMB12.6 million of the trade balance; and the loan to the associated company of RMB20 million (Note 9) remained outstanding, while the loan extended to a third party (Note 9) has been fully received.\nThe Group measures the loss allowances of trade and other receivables using the \u2018roll rate\u2019 method, based on receivables ageing and expected loss rate, and made adjustments for trade receivables from customers to reflect current conditions.\nContract assets relate to unbilled work in progress. The Group measures the loss allowances of contract assets at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, which is calculated using a simplified approach using a provision matrix, to compute the expected credit loss for retention sum and unbilled receivables from customers. In the provision matrix, the Group uses the actual historical credit loss experience over the past four years, adjusted for forward-looking overlay. Management is of the view that the historical conditions are representative of the conditions prevailing at the reporting date as the customer profile has not changed.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230716OTHROCEZ_Sapphire Corporation Limited_20230716222234_00_AR_4Q_20221231.1.pdf", "page_number": [12, 15]}, {"question": "Who is the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee of Sapphire Corporation Limited?", "answer": "Tay Eng Kiat Jackson", "raw_text": "Who is the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee of Sapphire Corporation Limited?\n###ANSWER: Tay Eng Kiat Jackson", "pages": ["\n\nSAPPHIRE CORPORATION LIMITED 137\nANNUAL REPORT 2022\n6.

On an annual basis, the ARC reviews and approves annual internal audit plan as well as any further requirements in professional resources to conduct the required internal audit reviews. The key findings from the internal audit reviews are also shared with the risk management team and the CRO, to facilitate the necessary inclusion in the consideration of the Group\u2019s risks during the risk assessment process.\nAs part of the work done to provide the basis for the opinion on internal control, the ARC also assesses the findings of: (i)\n\nthe internal audit visits performed on the activities   or entities within scope;\n(ii) the evaluation of the framework of risk   governance; and\n(iii) the assessment of adequacy of risk management   and internal controls over financial, operational   and compliance risk as principally managed by the   first and second line roles.\nThe ARC also evaluates any weaknesses or material non-compliance identified by the External Auditors during the course of their financial audit, and the effectiveness of remediation actions taken to address the issues reported (if any).\nThe quality of the Internal Audit is regularly assessed to ensure compliance with the IIA Standards. During the financial year ended 31 March 2023, the Company engaged one of the big four accounting firms, other than DT, to perform a Quality Assurance Review (\u201cQAR\u201d) on the internal audit function, based on Standard 1312 \u2013 External Assessments of International Professional Practices Framework of the IIA. The QAR covered the attribute standards (attributes of the function and individuals that perform internal audit) and the performance standards (which defines the nature of internal audit and provides quality criteria to measure the performance of these services). The QAR confirmed that the IAD generally conforms with the requirements of the IIA Standards in all material respects.\nThe ARC considers that the internal audit function is independent, effective and adequately resourced.\nIndependent Meeting with External Auditors without the Management (Provision 10.5)\nThe ARC also meets annually with the External and Internal Auditors, without the presence of the Management.\nD. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT\nPRINCIPLE CONDUCT OF GENERAL MEETINGS 11: SHAREHOLDER SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND\nThe company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably in order to enable them to exercise shareholders\u2019 rights and have the opportunity to communicate their views on matters affecting the company. The company gives shareholders a balanced and understandable assessment of its performance, position and prospects.\nShareholders\u2019 Participation in General Meetings (Provision 11.1)\nShareholders are informed of the AGM and/or EGM (a \u201cGeneral Meeting\u201d and collectively, \u201cGeneral Meetings\u201d) through notices sent to them. All shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at General Meetings in person or by proxy or in the case of a corporate shareholder, through its appointed representative. They are given the opportunity to communicate their views and to put forth any questions they may have on the motions to be debated and decided upon.\nNotices of General Meetings together with related documents such as annual report or circular to shareholders, are sent to every shareholder of the Company. The notices of General Meeting include information on, inter alia, the effect of the proposed resolutions in respect of the non-routine businesses.\nThe notices of General Meetings are also published in a major local newspaper and announced via SGXNet and made available on the Company\u2019s website at http://www.gp.industries.\n", "\nIn order to provide ample time for the shareholders to review, the notice of AGM, together with the annual report, is announced via SGXNet and the Company\u2019s website fourteen (14) days before the scheduled AGM date. Shareholders are encouraged to attend the General Meetings to ensure a high level of participation and accountability.\nAs part of the Group\u2019s sustainability efforts, starting from the AGM held on 29 July 2022 (the \u201c2022 AGM\u201d), the Company will only distribute printed copies of the notice of AGM and proxy form to its shareholders. Printed copies of the annual report relating to the meeting, which will be available online as above-mentioned, will only be distributed upon request.\nThe Company allows any shareholder (who is not a relevant intermediary), who is unable to attend a General Meeting in person, to appoint not more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote in his or her place at the General Meetings via proxy forms submitted in advance (i.e. not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time appointed for holding the General Meeting).

Relevant intermediary includes corporations holding licenses in providing nominee and custodial services and Central Provident Fund Board which purchases shares on behalf of the Central Provident Fund investors. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.\nTherefore, indirect investors can be appointed as proxies to participate in General Meetings and are given the same right as direct investors in General Meetings.\nConduct of Resolutions and Voting (Provision 11.2)\nThe Company puts substantially separate issues to vote at a General Meeting as separate resolutions, unless the resolutions are interdependent and linked to form one significant proposal. Where the resolutions are\n\n\u201cbundled\u201d, detailed explanatory notes including the\nreasons and material implications on each item of the agenda will be provided in the notice of General Meeting.\nAll shareholders, other than those who are considered the \u201cInterested Persons\u201d in an IPT (as defined in the Listing Manual) subject to the approval by the shareholders, are entitled to vote at General Meetings.\nIn addition, at a General Meeting, the Company Secretary and representatives from the share registrar\u2019s office are also available to provide shareholders with information on the rules that govern the meeting, including voting procedures.\nAbsentia Voting at General Meetings (Provision 11.4)\nShareholders are encouraged to attend the Company\u2019s General Meetings. As discussed above, subject to the provisions of the Company\u2019s Constitution and the Companies Act, shareholders who are unable to attend and vote in person or indirect shareholders can appoint proxy or proxies to attend and vote at all General Meetings on his/her behalf. However, voting in absentia is currently not implemented but the Company will consider voting in absentia when issues relating to security and authenticity of shareholders\u2019 identity, and other pertinent issues are resolved.\nSince the Company\u2019s AGM held on 29 July 2016, resolutions are voted by poll at General Meetings. As such, shareholders who are present in person or represented by proxies will be entitled to one (1) vote for each share held. The shareholders are informed of the voting procedures at the commencement of the General Meetings. Independent scrutineers are appointed to ensure the poll is properly conducted and the results are properly compiled. At a General Meeting, results of electronics poll are immediately displayed after a resolution is put to vote. Outcome of a General Meeting, the name of the independent scrutineer and other relevant information is announced to SGXNet after each General Meeting pursuant to the rules of the Listing Manual.\n", "Interaction with Shareholders (Provision 11.3)\nAt General Meetings, shareholders are given the opportunity to communicate their views and ask questions regarding the Group and matters tabled at the meeting. All Directors, including the Lead ID, the chairman of the respective Board Committees, certain members of the Management are available to address questions raised at General Meetings. In addition, the External Auditors, Deloitte, are also invited to attend AGMs to address questions which are related to the conduct of the audit. In EGMs, external professional advisors engaged in advising the matters being put to vote are invited to attend the meetings, so that the shareholders can seek necessary clarification directly from these professional advisors.\nAttendance of Directors at the General Meetings held during FY2023 are disclosed under the section headed \u201cBoard and Board Committee Meetings (Provision 1.5)\u201d of this Report.\nArrangements for 2022 AGM\nThe 2022 AGM was held by way of physical meeting and the Company did not distribute physical copies of the annual report and Letter to Shareholders, only the notice of the AGM, proxy form and request form were sent to shareholders.

Alternatively, shareholders can submit their request via the request form if they wish to receive printed copies of the annual report and Letter to Shareholders.\nArrangements for AGM to be held on 25 July 2023 (the \u201c2023 AGM\u201d)\nWith the easing of COVID-19 safe management measures, the Company will hold a physical meeting for its 2023 AGM, which enables the Company to resume its past practices on shareholders rights and conduct of general meetings as discussed below.\nMinutes of General Meetings (Provision 11.5)\nThe proceeding of each of the General Meetings will be properly recorded, including substantial or relevant comments or queries from shareholders relating to the agenda of the General Meetings and responses from the Board and Management. Minutes of the General Meetings are available on the Company\u2019s corporate website.\nDividend Policy (Provision 11.6)\nThe Company does not have a formal dividend policy.

It also has operations in Malaysia, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the People\u2019s Republic of China albeit in a smaller scale.\nTranslation risks of overseas net investments are not hedged through hedging instruments.\nCurrency exposure to the net assets of the Group\u2019s foreign operations in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Malaysia and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam are managed primarily through natural hedges of matching assets and liabilities. Management reviews periodically so that the net exposure is kept at an acceptable level.\nThe Group does not have any other significant unhedged exposure to currency risks as sales and purchases are primarily denominated in the respective functional currencies of the Group entities, mainly Singapore Dollars (\u201cSGD\u201d), Malaysian Ringgit (\u201cMYR\u201d), Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) and Vietnamese Dong (\u201cVND\u201d), except as disclosed below:\n\t\t\n", "Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n31.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)\na) Interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in the market interest rates.\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from loans and borrowings. The Group\u2019s policy is to obtain the most favorable interest rates available using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts without increasing its foreign currency exposure.\nSurplus funds are placed with reputable banks.\nInformation relating to the Group\u2019s interest rate exposure is also disclosed in the notes on the Group\u2019s loans and borrowings (Note 18).\nThe following tables set out the carrying amounts of the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and have maturity of within one year:\n\n | Group |  | Company\n2022   $\u2019000 |  | 2021   $\u2019000 | 2022   2021   $\u2019000   $\u2018000\nFixed rate\n\nCash equivalents | 6,045 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2012\nFixed deposits | 17,159 | 9,275 | \u2013 | \u2012\nFloating rate\n\nCash and bank balances | 9,262 | 48,972 | 595 | 15,710\nLoans and borrowings | (15,643) | (9,306) | \u2013 | \u2012\nThe Group and Company did not have any financial instruments with maturity beyond 1 year.\nSensitivity analysis for interest rate risk\nThe impact on the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates based on management\u2019s assessment, with all other variables held constant, of the Group\u2019s loss before tax and of the Company\u2019s loss before tax (through the impact of interest expense on floating rate loans and borrowings) and the Group\u2019s and Company\u2019s equity is $15,000 in 2022 (2021: $24,000).\nThere is no other impact on the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s equity other than those already affecting income.\n", "\nMEDTECS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION LIMITED\n(Incorporated in Bermuda)\nAND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in United States dollars unless otherwise stated)\n32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)\nb) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of financial assets and liabilities.\nIn the management of liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and bank balances deemed adequate by the management to finance the Group\u2019s operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank borrowings and debentures. As at 31 December 2022, 100% (2021: 100%) of the Group\u2019s debt will mature in less than one year.\nAdditional short-term funding is obtained from short-term bank loans.\nThe table summarises the maturity profile of the Group\u2019s and Company\u2019s financial assets and financial liabilities at the end of the reporting period based on contractual repayment obligations:\n2022\n\nGroup | Total   carrying |  |  |  |  | \n | value | On demand | < 1 year | 1 - 5 years | > 5 years | Total\n | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000\nUndiscounted financial assets:\n\nCash and cash equivalents | 18,122 | 12,078 | 6,044 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 18,122\nFixed deposits | 17,159 | \u2013 | 17,159 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 17,159\nTrade receivables - net | 30,358 | 20,942 | 9,416 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 30,358\nOther current assets   (1) | 1,648 | \u2013 | 1,648 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 1,648\n(2)   Other non-current assets | 3,000 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 3,000 | \u2013 | 3,000\nTotal undiscounted financial   assets | 70,287 | 33,020 | 34,267 | 3,000 | \u2013 | 70,287\nUndiscounted financial liabilities:\n\nLoans and borrowings   Trade payables and other | 15,643 | \u2013 | 15,643 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 15,643\n(3)   current liabilities | 6,256 | 6,256 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 6,256\nLease liabilities | 3,910 | \u2013 | 830 | 1,817 | 10,660 | 13,307\nTotal undiscounted financial   liabilities | 25,809 | 6,256 | 16,473 | 1,817 | 10,660 | 35,206\n\nTotal net undiscounted   44,478   26,764   financial assets/(liabilities)   (1) Excluding prepayments, tax receivables and advances to suppliers - net.

Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are\nKey Audit Matter\nA key audit matter is a matter that, in our professional judgment, was of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter.\nIn our audit of the financial statements of the current period, we continued to include the key audit matter for the prior period audit, \u201cReasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\u201d as the key audit matter for the current period.\n", "\nReasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\nThe key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\nDaiwa Securities Group Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d), as a holding company of a comprehensive securities group, holds large amounts of shares of subsidiaries and associates. The Company recognized shares of subsidiaries and associates of \u00a5628.6 billion and an allowance for investment losses of \u00a54.1 billion on the balance sheet as at the end of the current fiscal year. Shares of subsidiaries and associates include shares without market prices the Company acquired at a price that reflect future excess earning power. To assess the reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates, we primarily performed the following audit procedures: (1) Internal control testing\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the Company\u2019s internal controls relevant to the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates. In this assessment, we focused our testing on the following controls:\nAs described in the Note, \u201cSignificant accounting policies, 1 Valuation standards and methods for major assets\u201d to the financial statements, shares of subsidiaries and associates are valued at cost based on the moving average method in the balance sheet. If the substantive value of the subsidiaries and associates has declined significantly, an impairment loss shall be recognized unless its recoverability is supported by sufficient evidence. In addition, as described in the Note, \u201cSignificant accounting policies, 3 Accounting policies for provisions\u201d to the financial statements, even if any impairment loss is not eventually recognized, to prepare for losses arising from the shares of subsidiaries and associates, the Company provides an allowance for investment loss in an amount equivalent to a decline in the substantive value of the shares, taking into consideration of their actual situation. \u2022\n\ncontrols to ensure that the internal rules for the\nvaluation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\ncomply with accounting standards and other applicable\nrequirements; and\n\u2022 controls to ensure that the substantive value of shares of subsidiaries and associates by considering whether the excess earning power reflected is reasonable.\n(2) Assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation of shares of subsidiaries and associates\nIn order to evaluate the reasonableness of judgments on recognizing an impairment loss or an allowance for investment loss on shares of subsidiaries and associates with declining substantive value, we assessed the extent to which a loss had been incurred, as well as whether there was sufficient evidence supporting recoverability. This assessment included the following audit procedures:\nThe amount of shares of subsidiaries and associates accounts for a certain percentage (approximately 27%) of the total assets. In addition, the measurement of excess earning power, which is taken into consideration in the calculation of the substantive value, and assessment of recoverability of the substantive value based on business plans includes judgment by management, which may have a significant impact on the financial statements. \u2022 Evaluation of the operating status and excess earning power of subsidiaries and associates\nIn order to understand the operating status of the subsidiaries and associates and to revaluate the excess earning power reflected in their acquisition costs, we inspected materials used in management\u2019s evaluation of the operating status, including results of the analysis on the status of achievement of their business plans and the causes of the difference between the plan and actual results, and the appropriateness of business improvement measures. In addition, we assessed the reasonableness of management\u2019s evaluation of shares of subsidiaries and associates by inspecting an evaluation report from an external valuation company and performing an analysis based on publicly available information on the industry trends of subsidiaries and associates we independently obtained.

Financial risk management objectives and policies\nThe Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group\u2019s overall business strategies, tolerance of risk and general risk management philosophy are determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with prevailing economic and operating conditions.\nThe following sections provide details regarding the Group\u2019s and Company\u2019s exposure to the above-mentioned financial risks and the objectives, polices and processes for the management of these risks.\n(a) Foreign currency risk\nWith the disposal of non-current asset held for sale (investment in joint venture, Shanghai Snow Star), the Group currently operates primarily in Singapore, Indonesia and United Kingdom and as a result, is exposed to foreign currency risk from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, arising from its normal business activities.\nThe Group does not enter into derivative foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency borrowings to hedge against foreign currency risk. Exposures to foreign currency risks are managed as far as possible by natural hedges of matching assets and liabilities.\nAt the end of the reporting period, the material carrying amounts of monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective Group entities\u2019 functional currencies are as follows:\n\n |  |  | Group |  | \n | Assets |  |  |  | Liabilities\n2023 |  | 2022 |  | 2023 | 2022\n\nUnited States Dollar | 510 | 398 | (9,044) | (10,142)\nThe Group is also exposed to currency translation risk arising from its net investments in foreign operations, including Indonesia, Hong Kong and United Kingdom. The Group\u2019s net investments in Indonesia, Hong Kong and United Kingdom are not hedged as currency positions in Indonesian Rupiah, Hong Kong Dollar and Great British Pound are considered to be long-term in nature.\n", "\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n36. Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont\u2019d)\n(a) Foreign currency risk (cont\u2019d)\nSensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group\u2019s loss before tax to a 6% (2022: 2%) strengthening in the relevant foreign currency against the functional currency of each of the Group\u2019s entity, with all other variables held constant.\nGroup\n\n2023 | 2022\n\n | Increase in loss before tax\nImpact on loss before tax: | \nUnited States Dollar | 512   195\nThe opposite applies if the relevant foreign currencies were to weaken by 6% (2022: 2%) against the functional currency of each entity within the Group.\nThe Company\u2019s monetary assets and monetary liabilities are denominated in its functional currency, Singapore Dollars. Accordingly, no foreign currency sensitivity analysis is presented.\n(b) Interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from their bank borrowings.\nInterest rate sensitivity\nAt the end of the reporting period, if interest rates had been 100 basis points (2022: 50 basis points) higher or lower with all other variables held constant, the Group\u2019s loss before tax would have been $803,000 (2022: $372,000) higher/lower. This is mainly attributable to the Group\u2019s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate bank loan.\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty default on its obligations. The carrying amount of trade and other receivables, other current assets excluding prepayments and cash and bank balances represent the Group\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk. No other financial assets carry a significant exposure to credit risk.\nThe Group\u2019s objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increased credit risk exposure. The Group adopts a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties based on their trading and payment history as well as such commercial information which the Group obtains from time to time. Credit exposure is controlled by the counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by management annually.\nThe Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.\nThe Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments, within 90 days when they fall due, which are derived based on the Group\u2019s historical information.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230714OTHRXUIE_Kop Limited_20230714202221_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [3, 6]}, {"question": "What is the deadline for shareholders to submit their proxy forms?", "answer": "2.00 p.m. on 23 September 2023", "raw_text": "What is the deadline for shareholders to submit their proxy forms?\n###ANSWER:\n2.00 p.m. on 23 September 2023", "pages": ["\nLETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n16.

Framework for Remuneration \u2013 Level and Mix\nIn accordance with the basic remuneration framework established, the remuneration of the Executive Director and key management personnel comprises a basic salary component and a variable discretionary bonus component tied to the performance of the Group as a whole and their individual performances. There are no pre-determined performance conditions for the grant of discretionary bonus. The discretionary bonus is based on qualitative criteria (including leadership, people development, commitment, teamwork, current market and industry practices) and quantitative criteria. including production, profit after tax and relative financial performance of the Group to its industry peers.\nThe remuneration framework set by the RC for key management personnel of the Group comprises a larger proportion of fixed component in comparison with the variable discretionary component, as the overall objective of the Group is currently to better its financial position and profits, and to take into account the need to retain and motivate key management personnel and their responsibilities in managing key operating units of the Group. The level and mix of remuneration for the Executive Director comprises a smaller proportion of fixed components and a larger proportion of variable components.\nFor FY2023, a discretionary bonus recommended by the Management to each of Mr. Blythman, Mr. William Koh and Mr. Danny Ong Swee Hin (being key management personnel) was accepted by the RC.\nIn accordance with Provision 7.2 of the Code, the Independent Directors each receives a director\u2019s fee in accordance with their contributions, taking into account factors such as e\ufb00ort and time spent and their responsibilities. The fees are recommended by the RC and endorsed by the Board for approval by shareholders at the annual general meeting of the Company. Other than a director\u2019s fee, the Independent Directors did not receive any other remuneration from the Company. The RC has recommended and the Board has endorsed for shareholders\u2019 approval at the annual general meeting for FY2023 a total of S$49,831 in directors fees to be paid to the Independent Directors. The fee of S$49,831 includes all fees payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries. As the Group does not have a share plan in place, the remuneration of all Independent Directors comprises only of the director\u2019s fee proposed to be paid to them.\nEach Independent Director receives a director\u2019s fee (as proposed in aggregate) appropriate to their level of contribution to the Board, taking into account factors such as e\ufb00ort and time spent, specific responsibilities and the need to pay competitive fees to attract, retain and motivate Independent Directors.

The increase in the Group\u2019s revenue was a result of the following:\n(i) \t\t net increase in revenue of S$7.0 million from the restaurants operating under the \u201cYakiniku Shokudo\u201d brand\nThe Group launched a Halal brand \u201cYakiniku Shokudo\u201d in February 2022 which generated revenue of S$7.1 million in FY2023. There were eight restaurants under \u201cYakiniku Shokudo\u201d in FY2023. The increase in revenue was due to the opening of seven new \u201cYakiniku Shokudo\u201d restaurants.\n(ii) net increase in revenue of S$2.4 million from the restaurants operating under the \u201cTokyo Shokudo\u201d brand\nThe Group\u2019s revenue from restaurants operating under the \u201cTokyo Shokudo\u201d brand increased from S$10.3 million in FY2022 to S$12.7 million in FY2023 due to the full-year recognition of revenue from restaurants operating in Lot One, City Square Mall, Causeway Point and Vivo City and revenue generated from a new restaurant located at Sengkang Grand Mall which opened in March 2023. The increased revenue was partially offset by lower revenue generated from certain existing restaurants.\n(iii) net increase in revenue of S$3.6 million from the restaurants operating under \u201cAjisen Ramen\u201d brand\nThe Group\u2019s revenue from restaurants operating under the \u201cAjisen Ramen\u201d brand increased from S$15.1 million in FY2022 to S$18.7 million in FY2023 due to higher revenue generated by certain existing restaurants. The increase was partially offset by the conversion of an existing \u201cAjisen Ramen\u201d restaurant located in Square 2 to a \u201cYakiniku Shokudo\u201d restaurant in November 2022.\n(iv) net increase in revenue of S$1.3 million from the restaurants operating under the \u201cMenya Musashi\u201d brand\nThe Group\u2019s revenue from restaurants operating under the \u201cMenya Musashi\u201d brand increased from S$4.1 million in FY2022 to S$5.4 million in FY2023 due to higher revenue generated by certain existing restaurants.\n(v) net increase in revenue of S$0.6 million from the restaurants operating under the \u201cShitamachi Tendon Akimitsu\u201d brand\nThe Group\u2019s revenue from restaurants operating under the \u201cShitamachi Tendon Akimitsu\u201d brand increased from S$3.3 million in FY2022 to S$3.9 million in FY2023 mainly attributable to the full-year recognition of revenue from restaurants operating at Nex and Star Vista. The increase was partially offset by the conversion of a restaurant at Changi City Point in October 2022.\n(vi) net increase in revenue of S$2.0 million from the restaurants operating under the \u201cKonjiki Hototogisu\u201d brand\nThe Group\u2019s revenue from restaurants operating under the \u201cKonjiki Hototogisu\" brand increased from S$6.2 million in FY2022 to S$8.2 million due to higher revenue generated by certain existing restaurants. The increase was partially offset by the closure of a restaurant in Raffles City Mall in August 2022.\n(vii) net increase in revenue of S$1.3 million from the restaurants operating under the \u201cOsaka Ohsho\u201d brand\nThe Group\u2019s revenue from restaurants operating under the \u201cOsaka Ohsho\u201d brand increased from S$4.3 million in FY2022 to S$5.6 million in FY2023 due to higher revenue generated by certain existing restaurants which was partially offset by the conversion of a restaurant located at Waterway Point to an \u201cAjisen Shokudo\u201d restaurant in March 2023.\n(viii) net increase in revenue of S$6.1 million from the\n\nrestaurants operating under other brands\nThe Group recorded an increase in revenue from restaurants operating under other brands in FY2023 as compared to FY2022, which was mainly contributed by higher revenue from restaurants operating under the \u201cFruit Paradise\u201d, \u201cNakiryu\u201d, \u201cYakiniku Taro\u201d, \u201cNew ManLee Bak Kut Teh\u201d, \u201cYonehachi\u201d, \u201cAfuri Ramen\u201d, \u201cMenzo Butao\u201d, \u201cKazokutei\u201d and \u201cEdo Shokudo\u201d brands.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHR4OFY_Japan Foods Holding Ltd._20230705065716_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [18, 21]}, {"question": "Has Edmund Lai Sou Wei ever been convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty in Singapore or elsewhere?", "answer": "No", "raw_text": "Has Edmund Lai Sou Wei ever been convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty in Singapore or elsewhere?\n###ANSWER:\nNo", "pages": ["\nADDITIONAL INF ORMATI ON ON DIR E C TOR S SEEK ING R E -ELE C TION\nNAME OF DIRECTOR\nInformation required\n(a)\n\nWhether at any time during the   last 10 years, an application or a   petition under any bankruptcy law   of any jurisdiction was filed against   him or against a partnership of   which he was a partner at the time   when he was a partner or at any   time within 2 years from the date   he ceased to be a partner?\n(b)\nWhether at any time during the last 10 years, an application or a petition under any law of any jurisdiction was filed against an entity (not being a partnership) of which he was a director or an equivalent person or a key executive, at the time when he was a director or an equivalent person or a key executive of that entity or at any time within 2 years from the date he ceased to be a director or an equivalent person or a key executive of that entity, for the winding up or dissolution of that entity or, where that entity is the trustee of a business trust, that business trust, on the ground of insolvency?\n\n(c)   Whether there is any unsatisfied   judgment against him?\n(d)\nWhether convicted Singapore or elsewhere, involving fraud punishable or has been the subject of any criminal any pending criminal proceedings of which he is aware) for such purpose?

The Group sets the amount of equity capital in proportion to its overall financing structure. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debts.\n", "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023\n31.

Prolonged geopolitical tensions and trade disputes among major economies have also contributed to market volatility. It is indeed a complex landscape for interconnected businesses to navigate.\nDespite these external headwinds, the Group pursued a series of asset disposals, realising the gains in its investment in EG Industries Berhad (\u201cEG\u201d), unlocking deep value within its Electronics Business Unit (\u201cEBU\u201d), and welcoming a strategic investor in its Mechanical Business Unit (\u201cMBU\u201d).\nFollowing a sharp increase in the share price of Bursa Malaysia listed EG, the Group disposed of its shares in EG at an opportune time in February 2023 for a total consideration of approximately S$8.6 million.\nThe Group also completed the sale of its remaining stake in the WE Components Pte Ltd. (\u201cWEC\u201d) which forms the Group\u2019s EBU in August 2023, following the first disposal completed in March 2023. In total, WEC was disposed for a consideration of S$24.4 million and is no longer a subsidiary of the Group. Assuming the disposal of WEC had been effected at 31 March 2022, Net Tangible Assets (\u201cNTA\u201d) per share (SGD cents) surged from 10.58 to 18.30 after the disposal.\nLastly, the Group welcomed Optium Gains International Limited (\u201cOptium\u201d) as a strategic investor in Honfoong Plastic Industries Pte Ltd (\u201cHF \u2013 MBU\u201d), which forms a part of the Group\u2019s MBU. We saw value in retaining a stake in HF \u2013 MBU to capture potential long- term gains while Optium purchased a 37.1% stake in HF \u2013 MBU for a total consideration of S$1.86 million, the sale of which was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 6 September 2023.\nThe deep value unlocked for shareholders reflect the Group\u2019s forward thinking in a bid to drive long-term growth following the appointment of a new management team under my leadership back in 2014. We took a stragetic decision early on to leverage on merger and acquisition and strategic alliance opportunities with investments in WEC and EG, followed by HF \u2013 MBU later in 2018.\nPrior to these investments, Jubilee\u2019s revenue amounted to S$25.3 million for FY2013, which later surged past the S$200 million mark for FY2022. Following the disposals, the Group\u2019s cash and cash equivalents nearly doubled from S$6.6 million as at 31 March 2022 to S$12.8 million as at 31 March 2023. Furthermore, the Group generated positive cash flows of S$9.3 million for FY2023 as compared to negative cash flows of S$1.1 million for FY2022.\n", "OVERVIEW OF FY2023\nThe Group recorded a revenue of S$22.4 million from continuing operations relating only to the MBU for FY2023, a decrease of S$8.0 million or 26.3% as compared to S$30.4 million for FY2022. This was attributed to slower demand in plastic injection amidst intense competition from alternative materials.\nWhile the Group continues to exercise cost and operational efficiency measures, the stiff competition, higher raw material cost and rising inflation still posed challenges resulting in total expenses as a percentage of turnover increasing from 14.1% in FY2022 to 20.4% in FY2023.\nThe Group\u2019s EBU was classified separately as discontinued operations and its financial performance for FY2023 is discussed in the Financial and Operations Review sections of this Annual Report.\nThe divestment of the Group\u2019s EBU unlocked significant value and was in the best interest of the Group as it was exceptionally challenging in the current market environment for Jubilee to pursue the scale needed to generate sufficient profits. The electronic components industry in which the EBU operated is characterised by high capital requirements, with minimal profit margins from the distribution of electronic component products.\nOUTLOOK AND FUTURE PLANS\nThe MBU faces significant external headwinds with a slower- than-expected economic recovery and softened demand in its key market of China. Throughout much of FY2023, strict Covid-19 measures remained in place across China, disrupting economic activity and dampening domestic consumption.\nIn addition, the market supply of resin, which is a key raw material for the MBU remained tight throughout FY2023 due to logistics and labour issues exacerbated by disruption in resin production. Increasing pricing pressures from customers and foreign exchange volatility also present external challenges to the MBU.\nTo mitigate these challenges, the MBU has embarked on several initiatives to improve cost management as well as seeking qualification for alternative sources of raw materials and raising operational efficiencies to mitigate higher raw materials. The MBU also continues to diversify its customer base while expanding its product offering with higher margins.\nIn addition, we believe that through synergies with Optium, HF \u2013 MBU will have access to new customers, deeper expertise and stronger financial resources to thrive in the long term.\nMESSAGE CHAIRMAN\u2019S\nOn a positive note, the MBU\u2019s mould design and fabrication services business remains robust with new orders received from various industry segments. The Group will continue to explore opportunities for growth with investments for new tool fabrications.\nHaving unlocked significant value, the Group intends for a portion of the proceeds to be returned to shareholders. The Company will thoroughly assess any recommendation for distributions, taking into account factors such as retained earnings, financial position, capital expenditure needs, future expansion, investment plans, and other relevant considerations.\nThe Group is currently actively assessing new potential businesses for investment and will update shareholders in due course should any suitable opportunities arise.\nA NOTE OF APPRECIATION\nOn behalf of Jubilee, I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to our valued shareholders and business partners for their continued support throughout the years. We also recognise the hard work and contributions of our colleagues whose resilience has been instrumental in Jubilee\u2019s journey.\nWe remain firmly committed to the principles of integrity and innovation as we move forward and embark on a new chapter in the Group\u2019s evolution with the steadfast goal of creating long-term value for shareholders.\nDato\u2019 Terence Tea Yeok Kian\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJubilee Industries Holdings Ltd.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230926OTHRI4T0_Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd._20230926175412_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [3, 6]}, {"question": "What is Avjennings Limited?", "answer": "Avjennings Limited is a community developer.", "raw_text": "What is Avjennings Limited?\n###ANSWER:\nAvjennings Limited is a community developer.", "pages": ["Building on our past.

However, no options have been granted or agreed to be granted by the Company under the ESOS. The Company substituted the ESOS with the Performance Share Plan (\u201cPSP\u201d) in 2013.\nThe PSP was approved and adopted by the Shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 24 July 2013. The PSP which is administered by the RC will expire and lapse on 23 July 2023. The Company is seeking Shareholders\u2019 approval for the adoption of a new PSP at the Extraordinary General Meeting to be convened following the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.\nThe PSP provides an opportunity for employees of the Group who have contributed to the growth and performance of the Group (including Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors) and who satisfy the eligibility criteria as set out under the rules of the PSP, to participate in the equity of the Company. Controlling shareholders of the Company and their associates shall not be eligible to participate in the PSP. Non-Executive Directors are allowed to participate in the PSP to give recognition to their services and contributions and to align their interests with that of the Group. In order to minimise any possible conflicts of interest, the Non-Executive Directors will be primarily remunerated for their services by way of directors\u2019 fees. The Board does not envisage that the aggregate number of Shares comprised in awards set aside for the Non-Executive Directors collectively will exceed 1% of total issued share capital of the Company from time to time. The aggregate number of ordinary shares in the issued share capital of the Company (\u201cShares\u201d) over which the RC may grant on any date, when added to the number of Shares issued and issuable in respect of all Shares granted under the PSP and any other share schemes to be implemented by the Company shall not exceed 15% of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) on the day preceding that date.\nThe Company delivers Shares to participants upon vesting of the awards under the PSP by way of issuance of new Shares deemed to be fully paid upon their issuance and allotment or transfer of treasury shares pursuant to share buybacks.\nPursuant to the PSP, an aggregate of 490,000 treasury shares, constituting approximately 0.3% of the total number of issued shares of the Company as at 31 March 2023, were awarded on 9 December 2022. The Company has announced the details as required under Rule 704(32) of the Catalist Rules in relation to the grant of awards on 9 December 2022.\nSince the commencement of the PSP and up to the date of this report, an aggregate of 5,475,000 fully-paid shares, constituting approximately 3.1% of the total number of issued shares of the Company as at the date of this report, had been granted by the Company. Since the commencement of the PSP, none of the Directors has been awarded any shares under the PSP.\nExcept as disclosed in the table below, none of the participants under the PSP was granted 5% or more of the total number of Shares available under the PSP.

The responsibility of overseeing the Company\u2019s ERM and Assurance Framework is undertaken by the ARC with the assistance of the internal auditors. Having considered the Company\u2019s business operations as well as its existing risk management and internal control systems, the Board is of the view that a separate risk committee is not required for the time being.\nThe Board recognises the importance of maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the interests of the Group\u2019s assets. During FY2023, the ARC assisted the Board to oversee Management in the design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management and internal control systems and the ARC reported to the Board on critical risk issues, material matters, findings and recommendations pertaining to risk management.\nA summary of the Company\u2019s risk management and internal control systems is set out below.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nRisk Management\nThe Group recognises risk management as a collective effort beginning with the individual subsidiaries and business units, followed by the operating segments and ultimately, with the Management and the Board, working as a team. The CEO and senior management of the Company assume the responsibilities of the risk management function. They regularly assess and review the Group\u2019s business and operational environment to identify areas of significant financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks.\nThe Group has a risk management framework (\u201cERM Framework\u201d) in place which is aligned with ISO 31000.\nUnder the ERM framework:\n(a) Risks identified are aligned with the objectives of the Group;\n(b) A risk reporting structure is defined to identify the risk owners, approvers, champions and their respective risk responsibilities;\n(c) A risk reporting process is established which includes the identification, analysis and evaluation of risks, implementation of risk treatment plans and continuous monitoring of risks; and\n(d) Risks are evaluated on a common measurement matrix based on the likelihood and consequence of each risk identified. The risks are first identified on a gross level and subsequently on a residual level considering the risk treatment measures in place. The residual risk level determines the extent or risk exposure and further risk treatment measures required.\nOn an annual basis, the Management reports to the Board on updates to the Group\u2019s risk profile, risk treatments and results of assurance activities so as the assure that the process is operating effectively as planned.\nTo enhance the effectiveness of the ERM Framework, the Group implemented Orion ERM system, a third party software that automates the risk management, internal control and assurance functions and enables these functions to be managed on an integrated platform.\nInternal Controls\nInternal controls have been implemented to enhance the Group\u2019s functions in the areas of finance, operations, compliance and information technology. The internal control measures aim to secure that the Group\u2019s assets are safeguarded, proper accounting records are maintained, and that financial information used within the business and for publication is reliable.\nThe system of internal controls and risk management established by the Group provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be adversely affected by any event that can be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. However, the Board also notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, losses, fraud or other irregularities.\nAdequacy and Effectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control Systems\nThe risk management and internal control systems have been integrated throughout the Group and have been an essential part of its business planning and monitoring process.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHR4OFY_Japan Foods Holding Ltd._20230705065716_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [75, 78]}, {"question": "Who is the chairman of the audit and risk committee of Thomson Medical Group Limited?", "answer": "Mr Ong Pang Liang", "raw_text": "Who is the chairman of the audit and risk committee of Thomson Medical Group Limited?\n###ANSWER: Mr Ong Pang Liang", "pages": ["CORPORATE INFORMATION\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nMr Ng Ser Miang\n\nChairman, Non-Executive And\nIndependent Director\nMr Lim Wee Kiat\nExecutive Vice-Chairman\nDr Heng Jun Li Melvin\n\nExecutive Director And Group\nChief Executive Officer\nMr Wilson Sam\n\nExecutive Director and Group\nChief Financial Officer\nMs Wan Nadiah Binti Wan Mohd Abdullah Yaakob\n\nExecutive Director And Group\nChief Executive Officer \u2013 TMC\nLife Sciences Berhad\nMr Ong Pang Liang\nIndependent Director\nDr Lam Lee G\nIndependent Director\nMs Christina Teo Tze Wei\nIndependent Director\nMs June Leong Lai Ling\nIndependent Director\n\nAUDIT AND\nRISK COMMITTEE\nMr Ong Pang Liang\nChairman\nDr Lam Lee G\nMember\nMs June Leong Lai Ling\nMember\n\nNOMINATING AND\nR E MUN E RAT I O N\nCOM MI T T E E\nMr Ng Ser Miang\nChairman\nMr Ong Pang Liang\nMember\nMs Christina Teo Tze Wei\nMember\n\nCOMPAN Y\nS ECR ETAR I ES\nMs Foo Soon Soo\nMs Seah Sin Yuen\n\nS H AR E\nR EG I ST RAR\nM & C Services Private Limited\n112 Robinson Road #05-01 Singapore 068902\n\nIN D E P E N D E N T\nAUD ITO R\nErnst & Young LLP\nOne Raffles Quay North Tower Level 18 Singapore 048583\nMs Tan Peck Yen\nPartner-In-Charge (Appointed In FY2021)\n\nP R I N CI PAL\nBAN K E RS\nMalayan Banking Berhad\nStandard Chartered Bank\n\nR EG I ST E R E D\nO F F ICE\n\n101 Thomson Road #20-04/05\nUnited Square Singapore 307591\nTel : (65) 6331 0188 : (65) 6331 0180 : ir@thomsonmedical.com : www.thomsonmedical.com Fax Email Website\n", "\n(Reg.

The Group does not have a general mandate pursuant to Listing Rule 920 for interested person transactions.\nMaterial Contracts\nThere was no material contract entered into between the Company and or its subsidiaries involving the interests of any Director or controlling shareholder for the financial year under review.\nWhistleblowing\nThe Company has put in place a whistle blowing policy. The policy encourages employees to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible irregularities to Mr. Ramakrishnan and Mr. Koh. Such concerns include fraudulent acts, dishonesty, legal breaches and other serious improper conduct, unsafe work practices and any other conduct that may cause financial or non-financial loss to the Group or damage to the Group\u2019s reputation. It aims to provide an avenue for employees to raise concerns and at the same time provide reassurance to employees that they will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle blowing in good faith.\nWhenever a concern is raised in writing, by telephone or in person to the abovementioned persons, the whistle blower and the report received shall be treated with utmost confidentiality and will be attended to immediately or as soon as practicable. The whistleblowing policy will be posted on a notice board at each subsidiary\u2019s premises. The email addresses of Mr. Ramakrishnan and Mr. Koh are stated in the whistleblowing policy which can be also be found on the Company\u2019s website.\nWhen making a report, the whistleblower should provide the following information:\nName, NRIC and contact details; \uf020 \uf06c\nParties involved, time and place of the alleged improprieties; \uf06c\uf020\nEvidence leading to the improprieties, if any; and \uf06c\uf020\nAny other details or documentation that would assist in the evaluation of the improprieties. \uf06c\uf020\nSome concerns may be resolved by agreed action without the need for investigation. If an investigation is necessary, the whistleblowing committee member will commence an independent investigation. All whistle blowers have a duty to cooperate with investigations.\nThe AC oversees the administration of the whistle blowing policy. Periodic reports will be submitted to the AC specifying the number and details of the complaints received, results of the investigations, follow- up actions required and any unresolved complaints. There were no whistle blowing reports received for the financial year under review.\n", "\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON DIRECTORS SEEKING RE-ELECTION PURSUANT TO RULE 720(6) OF\nTHE SGX-ST LISTING MANUALS\nMr. Blythman and Mr. Sazali are the Directors seeking re-election at the forthcoming AGM to be held 29 September 2023 (\u201cAGM\u201d) under Ordinary Resolutions 3 and 4 (respectively) as set out in the Notice of AGM dated 14 September 2023.\nPursuant to Rule 720(6) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual, the information relating to the Retiring Directors is set out below:\nName of Director Mr. James Mo\ufb00att Blythman Mr. Sazali Bin Mohd Nor\nDate of Initial Appointment 28 May 2018 30 January 2019\nDate of last re-appointment (if applicable) 11 October 2021 11 October 2021\nAge 38 66\nCountry of principal residence Singapore Malaysia\nThe Board\u2019s comments on this appointment (including rationale, selection criteria, and the search and nomination process) The Board acknowledges the contributions of Mr. Blythman since his appointment.

A brief description of the background of each Director is presented in the \u201cProfiles of Directors\u201d section of this CG Report.\nSince 30 August 2022, the Board adopted a comprehensive diversity policy (\u201cDiversity Policy\u201d) which aims to support the Group\u2019s business and strategic objectives better so that the Group may achieve sustainable growth through the enhanced decision-making process of a Board that would comprise di\ufb00erent perspectives contributed by diverse range of individuals with di\ufb00erent but complementary skills, business experience, industry disciplines, gender, age, ethnicity, cultural background and nationalities, and other distinguishing qualities of its members.\nThe Diversity Policy provides a framework for setting the Company\u2019s diversity objectives, which includes:\nsetting targets to achieve more diversity on the Board; \uf06c\uf020\nplans and timelines for achieving the targets set; \uf06c\uf020\nrequirements to report progress made towards achieving the targets set within the timelines; and \uf06c\uf020\na description of how the combination of skills, talents, experience and diversity of its directors can serve the needs and plans of the Group. \uf06c\uf020\nThe Board is committed to achieving gender diversity, and the NC will, when reviewing and assessing the composition of the Board, prioritize achieving gender diversity when the Company makes its next appointment of a new Director.\nThe current members of the Board, while comprising only males, possess a range of skillsets, experiences, industry disciplines, ages, cultural and nationality diversity. While the Board will strive to achieve diversity as set out in its Diversity Policy, it will only appoint a director if his or her overall skills- set, experience are found to be suitable and appropriate for the Group\u2019s development and strategic objectives, based on recommendations made by the NC of the skillsets and experience that are needed to enhance the e\ufb00ectiveness of the Board.

In addition, each of the key operating subsidiaries has its own management team.

The division of duties and responsibilities of the Board and the Management have not been set out in writing. There are, however, as stated above certain matters reserved for the decision of the Board only.\nProvision 3.3 - Lead Independent Director\nThe Company does not have a Lead Independent Director as the leadership of the Board is not helmed by an Executive or Non-Independent Director or Chairman.

Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.\nThe Group has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $52.7 million as at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: $59.3 million).\nLeases as lessor\nThe Group leases out its investment properties (see note 4). All leases are classified as operating leases from a lessor perspective.\nOperating lease\nThe Group leases out its investment properties. Investment properties are held for use by tenants under operating leases. Generally, the leases contain an initial non-cancellable period of between 3 to 10 years and subsequent renewals are negotiated with the tenants to reflect market rentals.

The address of its registered office is at 10 Ubi Crescent, Ubi Techpark Lobby E, #03-94/95/96, Singapore 408564.\nThe principal activity of the Company is investment holding.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.\nThe financial statements, which are expressed in Singapore Dollar (\u201cS$\u201d), are rounded to the nearest thousand dollar (S$\u2019000), except as otherwise indicated.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group\u2019s accounting policies. It also requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.\nGoing concern assumption\nDuring the financial year ended 31 March 2023, the Group incurred a total loss of S$9,702,000 (2022: S$5,192,000). The directors of the Company have assessed that the going concern basis of preparation for this set of financial statements remains appropriate due to:\n(i) The Group has sufficient cash to fund the operations of the Group as the Group has net current assets of S$20,933,000 (2022: S$19,390,000) as at 31 March 2023; and\n(ii) On 29 August 2023, the Company has completed the disposal of an 86% equity interest in a subsidiary corporation, WE Components Pte. Ltd. for a total cash consideration of approximately US$15,900,000 (equivalent to S$21,500,000). The proceeds from the disposal will be utilised for general working capital purposes and the expansion of the Group\u2019s business\nAdoption of new and revised SFRS(I)s\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except that in the current financial year, the Group has adopted all the revised standards that are relevant to the Group and are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 April 2022.\nThe adoption of the revised standards did not result in substantial changes to the Group\u2019s accounting policies and had no material effect on the amounts reported for the current or prior financial years.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230926OTHRI4T0_Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd._20230926175412_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [48, 51]}, {"question": "What is the deadline to submit the proxy form for the AGM?", "answer": "2.30 p.m. on 26 July 2023", "raw_text": "What is the deadline to submit the proxy form for the AGM?\n###ANSWER:\n2.30 p.m. on 26 July 2023", "pages": ["Notice of Annual General Meeting\nBOUSTEAD SINGAPORE LIMITED\n(Incorporated in the Republic of Singapore) (Company Registration Number: 197501036K)\nSubmission of Proxy Form (4)\nA member (other than a Relevant Intermediary*) entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d) is entitled to appoint not more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote in his/her stead.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the trade receivables. The Group has identified the gross domestic product of the countries in which it operates to be the most relevant factors and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors.\nTrade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group.\nOther receivables\nLoss allowance for other receivables is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs. The ECLs on other receivables are estimated by reference to track record of the counterparties, their businesses and financial conditions where information is available, and knowledge of any events or circumstances impeding recovery of the amounts. At the end of the reporting period, no loss allowance for the Group\u2019s other receivables is required.\nAmounts due from subsidiaries and an associate (non-trade)\nThe Company has control over the operating, investing and financing activities of its subsidiaries. The use of advances to assist with the subsidiaries\u2019 cash flow management is in line with the Group\u2019s capital management. In determining the ECLs, management has taken into account the financial position of the subsidiaries and a forward-looking analysis of the financial performance of operations of the subsidiaries. In respect of the non-trade amounts due from subsidiaries which are repayable on demand, management has considered the availability of accessible and highly liquid assets of the subsidiaries for repayment if they are demanded at the end of the reporting period. Management has assessed that the Company is not exposed to significant credit loss in respect of the non-trade amount due from the subsidiary.\nNon-trade amounts due from other subsidiaries and an associate have been fully impaired taking into account the financial position of the subsidiaries and associate, and a forward-looking analysis of the financial performance of operations of the subsidiaries and associate. At the end of the reporting period, loss allowance of US$12,125,408 (2021: US$12,010,999) is required for the non-trade amounts due from subsidiaries and associate, which are credit-impaired.\nCash and bank deposits\nBank deposits are held with banks which are regulated. Impairment on cash and bank deposits has been measured on the 12-month ECL basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its bank deposits have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.

The Company Secretary administers and attends all Board and Board Committees meetings and prepares minutes of meetings. The Company Secretary is also responsible for, among other things, ensuring Board procedures are observed and that the relevant rules and regulations, including requirements of the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore, Securities and Futures Act 2001 and the Catalist Rules, are complied with.\nThe appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are subject to the approval of the Board.\nBOARD COMPOSITION AND BALANCE\nPrinciple 2: Strong and Independent Element on the Board\nProvision 2.1 Independence of Directors\nAs set out under the Code, an independent director is one who is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director\u2019s independent business judgement in the best interests of the Company.\nThe Board, taking into account the views of the NC, determines the independence of each Director on an annual basis or as and when circumstances require, based on the requirements under the Code and the Catalist Rules. In determining whether a Director is independent, the NC has adopted the definition in the Code of what constitutes an independent director and may take into account other relevant circumstances and facts. The Board considers whether a Director has or had business relationships with the Group, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers, and if so, whether such relationships could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Directors\u2019 independent judgement with a view to the best interests of the Group.\nFor FY2023, the NC has assessed the independence of Mr Tan Lye Huat, Mdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance, Mdm Tan Cher Ting and Mdm Chia Siok Mei, Sylvia, and is satisfied that there are no relationships or other factors such as past associations, business dealings, relationship with other Directors and the Management that could impair or compromise their independent judgement or which could deem them to be not independent.\nTo facilitate the NC in its review of the independent status of the Directors, each Director completes a checklist, prepared based on the principles of good corporate governance and relevant provision of the Code, to confirm his/her independence. The checklist will also indicate whether a Director considers himself/herself as an Independent Director despite not having any of the relationships identified in the Code.\nThe NC also reviews the checklist completed by each Director to determine whether a Director is independent. As a result of the assessment, the NC is satisfied that save as disclosed below, there is no relationship which would deem the Independent Directors to be not independent.\nTaking into consideration factors above, the NC is of the view that Mr Tan Lye Huat, Mdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance, Mdm Tan Cher Ting and Mdm Chia Siok Mei, Sylvia remain independent. The NC is satisfied that the Board has substantial independent elements to ensure that objective judgment is exercised on corporate affairs. All Independent Directors have also provided written declaration confirming their independence in accordance with the Code for FY2023.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nMdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance was appointed on 1 September 2011 and had served more than nine years on the Board. Under Rule 406(3)(d)(iv) and with reference to Transitional Practice Note 3 of the Catalist Rules, Mdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance may continue to be considered independent until the next annual general meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d) of the Company to be held in July 2024.\nSave for the above, there are no other independent Directors who has served beyond nine years from the respective date of their first appointment during FY2023.\nProvision 2.2 Independent Directors Comprising Majority of the Board\nUnder Provision 2.2 of the Code, independent directors should make up a majority of the Board where the Chairman is not independent. As at the date of this report, the Board comprises five members of which three are Independent Directors. With at least half of the Board comprising Independent Directors, there is a strong element of independence on the Board. With their expertise and competency in their respective fields, the Board engages in open and constructive debate and challenges the Management on its strategy proposals and assists in reviewing the performance of the Management in achieving set objectives. They are well-supported by the Management with accurate, complete and timely information to enable them to make informed decisions.\nInformation regarding each Board member is provided under the Board of Directors section set out on pages 20 to 21 of this report.\nDue to her work commitment, Mdm Chia Siok Mei, Sylvia has expressed her desire to retire at the conclusion of the AGM in July 2023. Upon her retirement as a Director, there will be four Directors on the Board, half of whom are independent. The Company will fill the vacancy arising from Mdm Chia\u2019s retirement as soon as possible, so that the Board will comprise a majority of independent directors in line with the requirements of the Code.\nProvision 2.3 Proportion of Non-Executive Director\nUnder Provision 2.3 of the Code, non-executive directors should make up a majority of the Board. The Company has complied with Provision 2.3 as the Board currently comprises five members of which four are non-executive Directors.\nProvision 2.4 Board Composition and Size\nThe Board recognises the benefit of diversity in fostering robust discussions and strives to achieve an appropriately balanced mix of talent on the Board, principally through combining Directors with diverse but complementary backgrounds and experiences, but also through gender and age diversity.\nEach Director has been appointed based on the strength of his/her calibre, experience and stature, and the Board, as a group, is made up of Directors with a wide range of skills, experiences and qualifications, ranging from accounting and finance expertise to industry knowledge, entrepreneurial and management experiences relevant to the Group\u2019s businesses.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nAs at the date of this report, the Board has five members, comprising three independent Directors, one non-executive Director and one executive Director.

With three out of five members of the Board being independent, the Company maintains a satisfactory independent element on the Board. The NC is of the opinion that the current Board composition represents a well-balanced mix of expertise and experience necessary to meet the requirements of the Company and the Group, and which facilitates effective decision making.\nBoard Diversity\nThe Company is committed to building and maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusivity, in terms of skillsets, knowledge, industry and business experience, educational background, gender, age, culture, geographical background, independence and professional qualifications. For this reason, the Company had adopted a board diversity policy (\u201cBoard Diversity Policy\u201d) which recognises and embraces the benefits of diversity on the Board, and views diversity at the Board level as an essential element in supporting the attainment of its strategic objectives and its sustainable development.\nThe current Board composition takes into consideration board diversity. To assist the NC in its annual review of the Directors\u2019 mix of skills and experiences required to discharge their duties competently and efficiently, each Director has completed a Board of Directors Competency Matrix form by providing additional information in their areas of specialisation and expertise in FY2023. The NC, having reviewed the responses, was satisfied that members of the Board possess the relevant core competencies in areas of accounting and finance, business and management experience, and strategic planning. In particular, the Non-Executive Directors, who are mostly professionals in their selected fields, are able to take a broader view of the Group\u2019s activities, contribute their valuable experience and provide independent judgement during the Board\u2019s deliberation on the Group\u2019s matters.\nIn recognition of the importance and value of gender diversity in the composition of the Board, the Company undertakes to have at least one female representation on the Board at all times. As at the date of this report, the Board has three female Directors, representing 60% of the total Board membership.\nIn addition, the Board consists of Directors with ages ranging from 40s to 70s, who have served on the Board for different tenures. The Board members with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group\u2019s business and direction.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHR4OFY_Japan Foods Holding Ltd._20230705065716_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [60, 63]}, {"question": "What is the total amount of the Group's financial liabilities as of 31 March 2023?", "answer": "HK$61,923,803,000", "raw_text": "What is the total amount of the Group's financial liabilities as of 31 March 2023?\n###ANSWER:\nHK$61,923,803,000", "pages": ["\nNotes to Financial Statements (Continued)\n\u8ca1\u52d9\u5831\u8868\u9644\u8a3b\uff08\u7e8c\uff09\n31 March 2023 2023\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\n45.

The Group would not release the property ownership certificates to the buyers before the buyers fully settle the payment.

As described in the Note, \u201cSignificant accounting estimates\u201d and \u201cFinancial instruments, 2 Fair value and fair value hierarchy by level of financial instruments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, the derivative assets and liabilities held as part of trading products categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, or Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities, were \u00a5117.8 billion and \u00a516.3 billion, respectively.\nAs described in the Note, \u201cAccounting policies, (1) Valuation standards and methods for major assets\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, derivative instruments held as part of trading products are measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet, while valuation gains or losses are reported within net gains or losses on trading in the consolidated income statement. The valuation gains recognized in the consolidated income statement for Level 3 derivatives instruments that were recognized in the consolidated balance sheet were \u00a535.2 billion. The information regarding Level 3 fair value is provided in the Note, \u201cFinancial instruments, 2 Fair value and fair value hierarchy by level of financial instruments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe fair values of over-the-counter derivative instruments are calculated using pricing models including those generally recognized in the market or the updated versions thereof. These pricing models are adjusted to reflect market practices by performing an analysis through the comparison with observable market information and alternative pricing models, or other means.\nTo calculate fair values using pricing models, various inputs, including interest rates, exchange rates, stock prices, volatilities and correlation coefficients, are used. In particular, unobservable inputs, including long-term swap- rates, long-term currency basis, long-term volatilities of stock prices, long-term credit spreads and correlation coefficients, are used to calculate the fair value of Level 3 derivative instruments.\nEstimating the fair value of Level 3 derivative instruments involves a high degree of estimation uncertainty and significant management judgment. The valuation requires complex processes based on a high level of expertise in the market and valuation methodologies primarily in the following areas:\n\u2022 Selecting and adjusting pricing models; and\n\u2022 Determining inputs used in the pricing models.\nWe, therefore, determined that our assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation of Level 3 derivative instruments held as part of trading products was one of the most significant matters in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly, a key audit matter.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\nTo assess the reasonableness of the valuation of Level 3 derivative instruments held as part of trading products, we primarily performed the following audit procedures:\n(1) Internal control testing\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the Company\u2019s internal controls relevant to the valuation of Level 3 derivative instruments held as part of trading products. In this assessment, we focused our testing on the following controls:\n\u2022\n\ncontrols in which inputs used in the pricing models\nincluding unobservable inputs and the marked-to-\nmarket valuation are validated by a department\nindependent of the trading department; and\n\u2022 controls in which the appropriateness of assumptions embedded in the pricing models and the appropriateness of valuation techniques, as well as adjustments to the pricing models are validated by a department independent of the department which developed the pricing models.\n(2)\n\nAssessment of the reasonableness of the valuation of\nLevel 3 derivative instruments held as part of\ntrading products\n\u2022 Assessment of the reasonableness of pricing models\nWe assessed the continuing appropriateness of assumptions embedded in the pricing models used to calculate the valuation of derivative instruments and the reasonableness of adjustments to those assumptions. We involved valuation specialists in financial instruments within our international network firms (hereinafter, the \u201cfinancial instrument valuation specialists\u201d) who assessed the reasonableness of the adjustments made to the pricing models during the current fiscal year.\n\u2022 Assessment of the reasonableness of inputs\nWe compared observable market inputs with data we independently obtained from information vendors and other sources. We also compared unobservable inputs primarily with consensus pricing data provided by a consensus pricing service provider and the values we estimated independently.\n\u2022 Assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation of derivative instruments calculated using the pricing models\nFor a sample of derivative instruments selected considering quantitative and qualitative significance, we independently calculated the valuation of those derivative instruments and compared them with the fair values calculated by management, with the involvement of the financial instrument valuation specialists.\n\u2022 Assessment of the appropriateness of relevant disclosures\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the balances by level and the information related to Level 3 fair value disclosed in accordance with the \u201cAccounting Standard for Calculation of Fair Value Measurement\u201d.\n", "Other Information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Securities Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements, and our auditor\u2019s reports thereon.

Financial instruments (cont\u2019d)\nb) Financial risk management (cont\u2019d)\nii) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the potential financial loss resulting from the failure of a customer or counterparty to settle its financial and contractual obligations to the Group as and when they fall due. The exposure to credit risk is monitored and assessed on an on\u2013 going basis. For trade receivables, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit history, and obtaining sufficient security where appropriate to mitigate credit risk. For other financial assets, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with high credit quality counterparties.\nAt the end of financial year, the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in the statements of financial position.\nThe following sets out the Group\u2019s internal credit evaluation practices and basis for recognition and measurement of expected credit losses (\u201cECL\u201d):\n\nDescription of evaluation of financial assets | Basis for recognition and   measurement of ECL\nCounterparty has a low risk of default and does   not have any past due amounts | 12-month ECL\nContractual payments are more than 30 days   past due or where there has been a significant   increase in credit risk since initial recognition | Lifetime ECL - not credit-impaired\nContractual payments are more than 90   days past due or there is evidence of credit   impairment | Lifetime ECL - credit-impaired\nThere is evidence indicating that the Group   has no reasonable expectation of recovery of   payments such as when the debtor has been   placed under liquidation or has entered into   bankruptcy proceedings, cannot be located   or are not recoverable despite legal recourse   made to recover the debt, and reminders and   warning letters issued for debts due for more   than 12 months | Write-o\ufb00\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nIn assessing whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial asset as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial asset as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information, such as future economic and industry outlook, that is available without undue cost or e\ufb00ort.\n", "\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the financial year ended 30 April 2023\n30. Financial instruments (cont\u2019d)\nb) Financial risk management (cont\u2019d)\nii) Credit risk (cont\u2019d)\nSignificant increase in credit risk (cont\u2019d)\nIn particular, the Group considers the following information when assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition:\n- existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant decrease in the debtor\u2019s ability to meet its debt obligations;\n-\n\nan actual or expected signifi cant deterioration in the operating results/key\nfinancial performance ratios of the debtor; and\n- an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor\u2019s ability to meet its debt obligations.\nThe Group regularly monitors the e\ufb00ectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.\nRegardless of the evaluation of the above factors, the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.\nThe Group also assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial asset is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if it has an internal or external credit rating of \u201cinvestment grade\u201d as per globally understood definition, or the financial asset has a low risk of default; the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.\nDefinition of default\nThe Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable.\n- when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or\n- information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collaterals held by the Group).\n", "SHAREHOLDERS\u2019\nINFORMATION\nSTATISTICS OF SHAREHOLDERS AS AT 4 SEPTEMBER 2023\n\nIssued share capital\nNumber of shares\nClass of Shares\nVoting rights\nNumber of Treasury Shares\n: S$265,811,043.25 6,180,799,986 Ordinary Shares One vote for each ordinary share NIL : :\n:\n:\nDISTRIBUTION OF SHAREHOLDERS BY SIZE OF SHAREHOLDINGS AS AT 4 SEPTEMBER 2023\n\nSIZE OF SHAREHOLDINGS | NO.

The NC also evaluates and reviews the Board succession plans for Directors to ensure progressive renewal of the Board, as well as the appointment and/or replacement of the Chairman, the CEO or key management personnel.\nThe NC has written terms of reference that set out its roles and responsibilities. The Board recognises the importance of progressively renewing the Board to address the evolving needs of the Company and is committed to a process of orderly succession planning for Directors.\nThe principal functions of the NC include:\n(a) recommending to the Board new Board appointments; (b)\nmaking recommendations on re-nomination of Directors, having regard to the Director\u2019s contribution and performance; (c)\nevaluating the independence of each of the Directors annually; (d)\nevaluating the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the contribution of each individual Director towards the effectiveness of the Board; (e)\nreview of succession plans for Directors and key management personnel; and (f)\nreview of training and professional development programmes for the Board and its Directors.\nProvision 4.3 Selection, Appointment and Re-appointment of Directors\nProcess for Selection and Appointment of New Directors\nThe Board recognises the importance of progressively renewing the Board to address the evolving needs of the Company and is committed to a process of orderly succession planning for Directors.\nThe NC reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on all nominations for appointments and re-appointments to the Board and the Board Committees. In the nomination and selection process, the NC will first review the Company\u2019s prevailing and emerging strategic priorities before reviewing the experience and expertise of the current Board composition to identify critical complementary gaps which require filling that are aligned to the strategic priorities of the Company.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nWhen an existing Director chooses to retire or the need for a new Director arises, either to replace a retiring Director or to enhance the Board\u2019s strength, the NC, in consultation with the Board, determines the selection criteria and identifies candidates with the appropriate expertise and experience for the appointment of a new Director. The NC may identify suitable candidates for appointment as new Directors through the business network of the Board members or engage independent professional advisers to assist in the search for suitable candidates. The NC will generally identify suitable candidates skilled in core competencies such as accounting or finance, business or management expertise, or industry knowledge taking into consideration the requirement for board diversity. If the NC decides that the candidate is suitable, the NC then recommends its choice to the Board. Meetings with such candidates may be arranged to facilitate open discussion. Upon appointment, arrangements will be made for the new Director to attend various briefings with the Management.\nThe Board is also advised by the Company\u2019s sponsor, UOB Kay Hian Private Limited, on appointment of Directors as required under Catalist Rules 226(2)(d).\nProcess for Re-appointment of Directors\nSuccession planning is an important part of the governance process. The NC oversees the nomination of Directors for election or re- election and seeks to balance Board renewal progressively and in an orderly manner. This brings in fresh insights with maintenance of knowledge and experience of the Company\u2019s operations and avoid losing institutional memory. The NC strives to ensure that the Board and its Committees comprise individuals who are best able to discharge their duties and responsibilities as Directors with regard to the highest standards of corporate governance.\nNo Director stays in office for more than three years without being re-elected by Shareholders. The Constitution provides that at least one-third of the Directors, including the CEO, shall retire from office by rotation at every AGM and Directors appointed during the course of the year will be subject to re-election at the next AGM following his/her appointment.\nThe NC deliberates the suitability of the Directors for re-election and takes into consideration their competencies, past contribution, attendance and participation at Board and Board Committee meetings, commitment, and performance during the previous year, and where applicable, the retiring Directors\u2019 independence. Each member of the NC shall abstain from voting on any resolutions in respect of the assessment of his/her re-election as a Director. The NC\u2019s recommendations will then be made to the Board for its approval, and Shareholders would be provided with relevant information on the Directors who will be standing for re-election at each AGM.\nIn accordance with the Company\u2019s Constitution and Rule 720(4) of the Catalist Rules, the following Directors are due for retirement at the forthcoming AGM:\n(a) Mr Eugene Wong \u2013 Regulation 101 of the Company\u2019s Constitution; (b)\nMdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance \u2013 Regulation 101 of the Company\u2019s Constitution; and (c)\nMdm Tan Cher Ting - Regulation 105 of the Company\u2019s Constitution;\n(together the \u201cRetiring Directors\u201d).\nAfter consideration of the Retiring Directors\u2019 overall contribution and performance, the NC had recommended to the Board that Mr Eugene Wong, Mdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance and Mdm Tan Cher Ting be nominated for re-election at the forthcoming AGM pursuant to Regulations 101 and 105 of the Company\u2019s Constitution. The NC\u2019s recommendation, which has been endorsed by the Board, follows the NC\u2019s assessment of the Directors\u2019 contributions, competencies, and commitments (including attendance, preparedness, participation at Board and Board Committee meetings).\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nAll the Retiring Directors have expressed their willingness to be re-elected as a Director of the Company at the forthcoming AGM, and upon re-election:\n(a) Mr Eugene Wong shall remain as the Non-Executive Vice Chairman of the Board (\u201cVice Chairman\u201d) of the Company and a member of the ARC, NC and RC respectively;\n(b) Mdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance shall remain as an Independent Director, Chairperson of the ARC, and a member of the NC and RC respectively; and\n(c) Mdm Tan Cher Ting shall remain as an Independent Director, Chairperson of NC and a member of the ARC and RC respectively.\nPlease refer to page 87 to 93 in the Annual Report for the detailed information required pursuant to Rule 720(5) of Catalist Rules.\nAt the forthcoming AGM, Mdm Chia Siok Mei, Sylvia will also retire from the Board at the conclusion of the meeting. Upon her retirement as a Director, there will be four Directors on the Board, half of whom are independent with the majority of Directors being non-executives. The Company will fill the vacancy arising from Mdm Chia\u2019s retirement as soon as possible so that the Board will comprise a majority of independent directors in line with the requirements of the Code.\nProvision 4.4 NC to Determine Directors\u2019 Independence\nThe NC deliberates annually to determine the independence of a Director bearing in mind the salient factors set out in the Code as well as all other relevant circumstances and facts. No member of the NC participated in the deliberation in respect of his/her own status as an independent Director.\nEach Director is required to disclose to the Board any relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect or could appear to affect the Director\u2019s judgement, as and when they arise. The Directors are also required, to complete annually, a confirmation of independence based on the substantive requirements of the Code and declare whether he/she considers himself/herself to be independent based on the criteria under the Catalist Rules and the Code, including, amongst others, the confirmation that he/she does not have any relationship with his/her fellow Directors or with the Group and its substantial shareholders. Such declarations are put before the NC to be reviewed annually in accordance with the definition of independence in the Code and the Catalist Rules to ensure that there is a strong independent element on the Board such that the Board is able to exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs independently.\nFor FY2023, the Independent Directors have confirmed that they are independent and do not have any relationship with the Company or its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Directors\u2019 independent business judgement with a view to the best interests of the Company.\nTaking into consideration factors above, the NC is of the view that the Independent Directors, Mdm Lee Sok Koon, Constance, Mdm Chia Siok Mei, Sylvia and Mdm Tan Cher Ting, remain independent. The NC is satisfied that the Board, in its current composition, has substantial independent elements to ensure that objective judgment is exercised on corporate affairs.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHR4OFY_Japan Foods Holding Ltd._20230705065716_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [66, 69]}, {"question": "What is the total amount of the Group's financial liabilities with a maturity of less than 1 year as of 31 December 2022?", "answer": "HK$5,376,000", "raw_text": "What is the total amount of the Group's financial liabilities with a maturity of less than 1 year as of 31 December 2022?\n###ANSWER:\nHK$5,376,000", "pages": ["Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2022\n21 Financial risk management (Cont\u2019d)\n21.4 Credit risk (Cont\u2019d)\nExposure to credit risk (Cont\u2019d)\n\n |  | Lifetime | Lifetime | \n | 12-month ECL | Expected   Credit loss | Expected   Credit loss | \n | Not credit | Not credit | Credit | \n | impaired | impaired | impaired | Total\nThe Group | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000\nLoans and advances\n\n- neither past due nor impaired | 27,600 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 27,600\n- past due but not impaired | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013\n- past due and impaired   Other receivables, excluding   Prepayments and income tax recoverable | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013\n- neither past due nor impaired | 41,071 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 41,071\n- past due but not impaired | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013\n- past due and impaired | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013\nGross amount | 68,671 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 68,671\nStage 3 loss allowances | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013\nAt 31 December 2021 | 68,671 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 68,671\n\n |  | Gross |  | \nThe Company |  | carrying | Loss | Net carrying\n | 12-month/ | amount | allowance | Amount\n | Lifetime ECL | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000\nAt 31 December 2022\n\nOther receivables   (1)   Amounts due from | 12-month ECL | 23 | \u2013 | 23\nsubsidiaries (non-trade) | 12-month ECL | 134,079 | (54,500) | 79,579\n |  | 134,102 | (54,500) | 79,602\nAt 31 December 2021\n\nOther receivables   (1)   Amounts due from | 12-month ECL | 27 | \u2013 | 27\nsubsidiaries (non-trade) | 12-month ECL | 134,013 | (50,321) | 83,692\n |  | 134,040 | (50,321) | 83,719\n(1) Excluded prepayment and income tax recoverable\nThe carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, grossed up for any allowances for losses, represents the Group\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account of the value of any collateral obtained.\n(1) Loans and advances and other receivables\nThe expected credit loss on loans and advances and other receivables are estimated by reference to payment history, current financial situation of the borrower, borrower-specific information obtained directly from the borrower and public domain, where available, and an assessment of the current and future wider economic conditions and outlook for the industry in which the borrower operates at the reporting date.\nLoans and advances and other receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

In determining the ECL, management has taken into account the finances and business performance of the subsidiaries, and a forward-looking analysis of the financial performance of investments and projects undertaken by these subsidiaries. For the non-trade amounts due from subsidiaries which are repayable on demand, expected credit losses are determined based on the availability of accessible and highly liquid assets of the subsidiaries for repayment if they are demanded at the reporting date. The impairment assessment for ECL is disclosed in Note 13.\n(3) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash is placed with financial institutions which are regulated and have good credit ratings. Expected credit loss on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. The amount of the allowance on cash and cash equivalents is negligible.\nFinancial assets that are neither past due nor impaired\nAs of 31 December 2022, other receivables and amounts due from subsidiaries (non-trade) for the Company of HK$79,602,000 (2021 - HK$83,719,000) and loans and advances and other receivables for the Group of HK$64,278,000 (2021 - HK$68,671,000) are neither past due nor impaired. Based on historical default rates, the Group believes that no expected credit losses is necessary in respect of these balances not past due as they mainly arise from borrowers that have a good credit record with the Group.\nFinancial assets that are past due but not impaired\nAs of 31 December 2022 and 2021, there are no financial assets that are past due but not impaired.\nFinancial assets that are past due and/or impaired\nAs of 31 December 2022, amounts due from subsidiaries (non-trade) for the Company of HK$54,500,000 (2021 - HK$50,321,000) are impaired.

Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its fair value.\nThe Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group\u2019s approach in managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group\u2019s reputation.\nThe Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and equivalent deemed adequate by management to finance the Group\u2019s operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. Management believes that it will have the necessary liquidity by scaling its business activities, collections from investments, loans and advances and /or raising funds as it deemed appropriate.\nThe table summarises the maturity profile of the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s financial liabilities at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments:\n\n |  |  | Contractual undiscounted cash flows | \n | Carrying |  | Less than   Between 2 | Over\n | amount | Total | 1 year   and 5 years | 5 years\nThe Group | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000   HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000\n31 December 2022\n\nOther payables | 5,376 | 5,376 | 5,376 | \u2013 | \u2013\n\n |  |  | Contractual undiscounted cash flows | \n | Carrying |  | Less than   Between 2 | Over\n | amount | Total | 1 year   and 5 years | 5 years\nThe Group | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000   HK$\u2019000 | HK$\u2019000\n31 December 2021\n\nOther payables | 8,377 | 8,377 | 8,377 | \u2013 | \u2013\nLease liabilities | 33 | 39 | 39 | \u2013 | \u2013\n | 8,410 | 8,416 | 8,416 | \u2013 | \u2013\nThe Company\n31 December 2022\n\nOther payables | 1,511 | 1,511 | 1,511 | \u2013 | \u2013\nLease liabilities | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013\n | 1,511 | 1,511 | 1,511 | \u2013 | \u2013\n31 December 2021\n\nOther payables | 1,929 | 1,929 | 1,929 | \u2013 | \u2013\nLease liabilities | 33 | 39 | 39 | \u2013 | \u2013\n | 1,962 | 1,968 | 1,968 | \u2013 | \u2013\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230613OTHRVT4V_Net Pacific Financial Holdings Limited_20230613203935_00_AR_4Q_20221231.1.pdf", "page_number": [3, 6]}, {"question": "Has Mr. Chng Hee Kok ever been convicted of any offence, in Singapore or elsewhere, involving a breach of any law or regulatory requirement that relates to the securities or futures industry in Singapore or elsewhere?", "answer": "No", "raw_text": "Has Mr. Chng Hee Kok ever been convicted of any offence, in Singapore or elsewhere, involving a breach of any law or regulatory requirement that relates to the securities or futures industry in Singapore or elsewhere?\n###ANSWER: No", "pages": ["INFORMATION ON\nDIRECTOR SEEKING RE-ELECTION\nName of Person Chng Hee Kok\n(b) Whether at any time Yes\nduring the last 10 years, an application or a petition under any law of any jurisdiction was filed against an entity (not being a partnership) of which he was a director or an equivalent person or a key executive, at the time when he was a director or an equivalent person or a key executive of that entity or at any time within 2 years from the date he ceased to be a director or an equivalent person or a key executive of that entity, for the winding up or dissolution of that entity or, where that entity is the trustee of a business trust, that business trust, on the ground of insolvency?

Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date (e.g. the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant). The amendments also clarify what SFRS(I) 1-1 means when it refers to the \u2018settlement\u2019 of a liability. The amendments could affect the classification of liabilities, particularly for entities that previously considered management\u2019s intentions to determine classification and for some liabilities that can be converted into equity.\nThe Group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.\nAmendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes\n\nDeferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (effective for annual periods beginning on\nor after 1 January 2023)\nThe amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes require companies to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. They will typically apply to transactions such as leases of lessees and decommissioning obligations and will require the recognition of additional deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2023\n32 New or revised accounting standards and interpretations (continued)\nAmendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes (continued)\nThe amendment should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, entities should recognise deferred tax assets (to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised) and deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of the earliest comparative period for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with:\n- right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and\n- decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities, and the corresponding amounts recognised as part of the cost of the related assets.\nThe cumulative effect of recognising these adjustments is recognised in retained earnings, or another component of equity, as appropriate. SFRS(I) 1-12 did not previously address how to account for the tax effects of on-balance sheet leases and similar transactions and various approaches were considered acceptable. Some entities may have already accounted for such transactions consistent with the new requirements. These entities will not be affected by the amendments.\nThe Group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.\n33 Authorisation of Financial Statements\nThese financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company on 28 June 2023.\n", "Statistics of Shareholdings as at 16 June 2023\n\nClass of Shares | : | Ordinary shares\nNumber of shares (excluding treasury shares) | : | 1,029,179,292\nVoting Rights | : | One vote per share\nNo. of treasury shares and percentage | : | Nil\nNo. of subsidiary holdings held and percentage | : | Nil\nDistribution of Shareholders by Size of Shareholdings\n\nSize of shareholdings | No. of   shareholders | % | No. of   Shares | %\n1 \t\t   - 99 | 12 | 1.29 | 704 | 0.00\n100 \t\t   - 1,000 | 49 | 5.26 | 31,320 | 0.00\n1,001   - 10,000 | 291 | 31.26 | 1,704,060 | 0.17\n10,001   - 1,000,000 | 553 | 59.40 | 46,770,500 | 4.54\n1,000,001 and above | 26 | 2.79 | 980,672,708 | 95.29\nTotal | 931 | 100.00 | 1,029,179,292 | 100.00\nTwenty Largest Shareholders\n\nNo. Name | No. of shares | %\n1   United Overseas Bank Nominees Pte Ltd | 624,187,240 | 60.65\n2   Phillip Securities Pte Ltd | 89,831,340 | 8.73\n3   KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte.

If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lessee.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise of the following, where applicable:\nfixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives; l\nvariable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; l\nthe amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; l\nthe exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and l\npayments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease. l\nThe lease liability is presented as a separate line in the statement of financial position.\nThe carrying amount of the lease liability includes interest on the lease liability (computed using the effective interest method) and the carrying amount will be reduced when the lease payments are made.\nThe right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\nWhenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and\nconditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent\nLiabilities and Contingent Assets. To the extent that the costs relate to a right-of-use asset, the costs are included in the related right-of-use asset.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.\nThe right-of-use assets are presented as part of property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position.\nThe Group applies SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss.\nDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES \u2013 Development properties are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes acquisition costs, development expenditure and other costs directly attributable to the development activities.\n", "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT\u2019D)\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. The write-down to net realisable value is presented as allowance for foreseeable losses.\nCONTRACT COSTS \u2013 Incremental costs of obtaining a contract for the sale of a development property are capitalised as contract costs only if (a) these costs relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract which the Group can specifically identify; (b) these costs generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and (c) these costs are expected to be recovered. Otherwise, such costs are recognised as an expense immediately.\nCapitalised contract costs are subsequently amortised on a systematic basis as the Group recognises the related revenue on the contract. An impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of capitalised contract costs exceeds the expected remaining consideration less any directly related costs not yet recognised as expenses.\nCONTRACT ASSETS \u2013 Contract assets primarily relate to the Group\u2019s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date on construction of development properties. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group invoices the customer.\nCONTRACT LIABILITIES \u2013 Contract liabilities primarily relate to:\nadvance consideration received from customers; and l\nprogress billings issued in excess of the Group\u2019s rights to the consideration. l\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\nRecognition and initial measurement\nNon-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities\nTrade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (\u201cFVTPL\u201d), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\nClassification and subsequent measurement\nNon-derivative financial assets\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (\u201cFVOCI\u201d) \u2013 debt investment; FVOCI \u2013 equity investment; or FVTPL.\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n", "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT\u2019D)\nFinancial assets at amortised cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\nit is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and l\nits contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. l\nFinancial assets: Business model assessment\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:\nthe stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice.

Financial instruments (cont\u2019d)\nb) Financial risk management (cont\u2019d)\niii) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group\u2019s approach to manage liquidity is to ensure the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities from financial institutions.\nThe Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by management to finance the Group\u2019s operations and to mitigate the e\ufb00ects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s going concern assumption is dependent on the assessment as disclosed in Note 3.\nThe Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s financial liabilities based on the remaining year at the end of the financial year to the contractual maturity date based on contractual undiscounted cash flows which include both interest and principal cash flows are as follows:\n\n | Group |  | Company\n2023 |  | 2022 | 2023   2022\nLess than one year:\n\nTrade and other payables | 13,988 | 15,236 | 6,319 | 6,357\nBorrowings | 10,780 | 14,288 | \u2013 | \u2013\nLease liabilities | 340 | 355 | \u2013 | \u2013\n | 25,108 | 29,879 | 6,319 | 6,357\nBetween 2 to 5 years:\n\nBorrowings | 12,534 | 9,727 | \u2013 | \u2013\nLease liabilities | 644 | 6 | \u2013 | \u2013\n | 13,178 | 9,733 | \u2013 | \u2013\n | 38,286 | 39,612 | 6,319 | 6,357\nc) Capital management\nThe Group\u2019s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholder value. In order to maintain or achieve an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend payment, issue new shares and obtain new borrowings.\nThe Group\u2019s management reviews the capital structure on an annual basis.

Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date (e.g. the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant). The amendments also clarify what SFRS(I) 1-1 means when it refers to the \u2018settlement\u2019 of a liability. The amendments could affect the classification of liabilities, particularly for entities that previously considered management\u2019s intentions to determine classification and for some liabilities that can be converted into equity.\nThe Group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.\nAmendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes\n\nDeferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (effective for annual periods beginning\non or after 1 January 2023)\nThe amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes require companies to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. They will typically apply to transactions such as leases of lessees and decommissioning obligations and will require the recognition of additional deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230713OTHR0HTB_Vividthree Holdings Ltd._20230713003157_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [3, 6]}, {"question": "What is the purpose of Resolution 9?", "answer": "Resolution 9, if passed, will authorize the Directors, from the date of this AGM up to the date of the next annual general meeting or the date by which the next annual general meeting is required by law to be held, to issue shares, make or grant instruments (such as warrants or debentures) convertible into shares and to issue shares pursuant to such instruments, up to a number not exceeding 50% of the total number of issued shares in the capital of the Company, of which up to 20% may be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders.", "raw_text": "What is the purpose of Resolution 9?\n###ANSWER:\nResolution 9, if passed, will authorize the Directors, from the date of this AGM up to the date of the next annual general meeting or the date by which the next annual general meeting is required by law to be held, to issue shares, make or grant instruments (such as warrants or debentures) convertible into shares and to issue shares pursuant to such instruments, up to a number not exceeding 50% of the total number of issued shares in the capital of the Company, of which up to 20% may be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders.", "pages": ["NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\nAS SPECIAL BUSINESS\nTo consider and, if thought fit, passing the following resolutions:\n1.

INTRODUCTION\nThe Directors are proposing to seek Shareholders\u2019 approval at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 26 September 2023 (the \u201c2023 AGM\u201d) for the proposed renewal of the Share Buy-Back Mandate.\nThe purpose of this Appendix is to provide Shareholders with information relating to, and to seek Shareholders\u2019 approval for, the proposed renewal of the Share Buy-Back Mandate to be tabled at the forthcoming 2023 AGM. The notice of the 2023 AGM is set out on pages 156 to 161 of the Annual Report.\nThe SGX-ST and Sponsor take no responsibility for the contents of this Appendix, including the accuracy, completeness or correctness of any of the information, statements or opinions made or reports contained in this Appendix.\n2. THE PROPOSED RENEWAL OF THE SHARE BUY-BACK MANDATE\n2.1 Background\nAt the AGM of the Company held on 27 September 2022 (the \u201c2022 approved the renewal of the Share Buy-Back Mandate to enable the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued Shares. The rationale for, and the authority and limitations on, the Share Buy-Back Mandate were set out in the Appendix to the Notice of AGM dated 5 September 2022 in relation to the 2022 AGM. AGM\u201d), Shareholders had\nThe existing Share Buy-Back Mandate will, unless renewed, expire on the date of the forthcoming 2023 AGM. Accordingly, Shareholders\u2019 approval is being sought for the renewal of the Share Buy-Back Mandate at the 2023 AGM.\nIf approved by Shareholders at the 2023 AGM, the authority conferred by the Share Buy-Back Mandate will take effect from the date of the AGM for the Relevant Period. The Companies Act allow a listed company to purchase its own shares. The information required in compliance with the Catalist Rules and the Companies Act is provided below.\n2.2 Rationale for the Proposed Renewal of the Share Buy-Back Mandate\nThe Share Buy-Back Mandate will give the Company the flexibility to purchase or otherwise acquire its Shares if and when circumstances permit, during the period that the Share Buy-Back Mandate is in force. The Directors believe that Share buy-backs would allow the Company and its Directors to better manage the Company\u2019s share capital structure, dividend payout and cash reserves. In addition, it also provides the Directors a mechanism to facilitate the return of surplus cash over and above the Company\u2019s ordinary capital requirements in an expedient and cost-efficient manner, and the opportunity to exercise control over the Company\u2019s share capital structure with a view to enhance the EPS and/or NAV per Share.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230911OTHRK6VF_Hc Surgical Specialists Limited_20230911074720_00_AR_4Q_20230531.2.pdf", "page_number": [6, 9]}, {"question": "What is the weighted average share price at the date of exercise for Options exercised during the year?", "answer": "The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for Options exercised during the year was nil (2022: nil).", "raw_text": "What is the weighted average share price at the date of exercise for Options exercised during the year?\n###ANSWER:\nThe weighted average share price at the date of exercise for Options exercised during the year was nil (2022: nil).", "pages": ["NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n27 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\n(a) Equity-settled ESOS (Continued)\nDetails of the specific categories of options are as follows:\n\n | Number of outstanding\nExercise Price | share options\n\nDate of grant | Exercise period | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022\n\n2016B | 24 August 2015 | 25 August 2018 to   24 August 2025 | S$0.268 | S$0.268 | 27,500 | 27,500\n2017C | 18 August 2016 | 19 August 2019 to   18 August 2026 | S$0.379 | S$0.379 | 132,000 | 132,000\n2018A | 27 September 2017 | 28 September 2019 to   27 September 2027 | S$0.701 | S$0.701 | 800,000 | 825,000\n2018B | 27 September 2017 | 28 September 2020 to   27 September 2027 | S$0.701 | S$0.701 | 1,970,000 | 2,070,000\n2019A | 21 September 2018 | 22 September 2020 to   21 September 2028 | S$0.530 | S$0.530 | 195,000 | 195,000\n2019B | 21 September 2018 | 22 September 2021 to   21 September 2028 | S$0.530 | S$0.530 | 1,970,000 | 2,050,000\n2020A | 15 November 2019 | 16 November 2021 to   15 November 2029 | S$0.570 | S$0.570 | 680,000 | 705,000\n2020B | 15 November 2019 | 16 November 2022 to   15 November 2029 | S$0.570 | S$0.570 | 2,310,000 | 2,390,000\n2021A | 18 November 2020 | 19 November 2022 to   18 November 2030 | S$0.460 | S$0.460 | 635,000 | 635,000\n2021B | 18 November 2020 | 19 November 2023 to   18 November 2030 | S$0.460 | S$0.460 | 1,765,000 | 1,765,000\n2022A | 7 December 2021 | 8 December 2023 to   7 December 2031 | S$0.530 | S$0.530 | 500,000 | 500,000\n2022B | 7 December 2021 | 8 December 2024 to   7 December 2031 | S$0.530 | S$0.530 | 1,390,000 | 1,390,000\n2023A | 15 November 2022 | 16 November 2024 to   15 November 2032 | S$0.490 | \u2013 | 220,000 | \u2013\n2023B | 15 November 2022 | 16 November 2025 to   15 November 2032 | S$0.490 | \u2013 | 1,080,000 | \u2013\n", "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n27 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\n(a) Equity-settled ESOS (Continued)\nIf the Options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the Options expire.

Accordingly, the Board works to a yearly meeting plan with corresponding agendas and pre-read papers. Agenda items include reports from the Executive Director and Chief Financial O\ufb03cer regarding the Group\u2019s operations and businesses outside of Singapore and from each Board committee. Other updates throughout the year came from the various business units and key functions, including from the external and internal auditors and the Company Secretary.

The expense ratio has been computed based on the guidelines laid down by the Investment Management Association of Singapore (\u201cIMAS\u201d). The calculation of the expense ratio at 30 June 2023 was based on total operating expenses of $416,207 (2022: $403,125) divided by the average net asset value of $40,794,211 (2022: $40,317,944) for the year. The total operating expenses do not include (where applicable) brokerage and other transactions costs, performance fee, interest expense, distribution paid out to unitholders, foreign exchange gain/ loss, front or back end loads arising from the purchase or sale of other funds and tax deducted at source or arising out of income received. The Fund does not pay any performance fee. The average net asset value is based on the daily balances.\n2. The portfolio turnover ratio is calculated in accordance with the formula stated in the Code on Collective Investment Schemes. The calculation of the portfolio turnover ratio was based on the lower of the total value of purchases or sales of the underlying investments, being sales of $1,001,185 (2022: purchase of $535,514) divided by the average daily net asset value of $40,794,211 (2022: $40,317,944).\n", "SINGAPORE INDEX FUND\n(Constituted under a Trust Deed in the Republic of Singapore)\nDETAILS OF TOP 10 HOLDINGS\n\n | As at 30 June 2023   Percentage   of share   capital   Dividends |  | \nCost | owned   received | Dividend | \n$ | %   $ | cover ratio | *\n\nDBS Group Holdings Limited   3,117,101 | 0.009 | 492,931 | 1.59\nOversea-Chinese Banking Corporation 3,365,317 | 0.010 | 316,000 | 1.86\nUnited Overseas Bank Limited   2,331,501   Singapore Telecommunications | 0.010 | 235,922 | 2.24\nLimited   2,764,390 | 0.006 | 111,823 | 0.90\nJardine Matheson Holdings Limited   2,539,578 | 0.011 | 88,861 | 0.57\nKeppel Corporation Limited   661,171 | 0.011 | 62,255 | 1.59\nCapitaLand Ascendas Trust   1,076,344   CapitaLand Integrated Commercial | 0.015 | 65,561 | 1.15\nTrust   1,082,270 | 0.007 | 64,765 | 1.03\nCapitaLand Investment Limited   599,247 | 0.007 | 41,688 | 0.95\nWilmar International Limited   1,531,391 | 0.004 | 47,447 | 3.02\n* Dividend cover ratio is the ratio of the company\u2019s net pro\ufb01t attributable to ordinary shareholders over the dividend payout as published in the latest annual report.\nSUMMARY OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 30 June 2023 30 June 2022\nCost / Cost /\nFair Value Fair Value\n$ $\nInvestments:\n\nCost | 30,044,784 | 30,002,047\nUnrealised gain on investments | 9,849,366 | 8,530,268\nNet Book Value | 39,894,150 | 38,532,315\n", "INFORMATION ON THE PARTICULARS OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER\nThe investment manager of the Singapore Index Fund is Singapore Consortium Investment Management Limited which is located at 250 Tanjong Pagar Road, #09-01 St Andrew\u2019s Centre, Singapore 088541.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters while optimising the return.\n(i) Interest rate risk\nThe Manager adopts a proactive interest rate management policy to manage the risk associated with adverse movement in interest rates on the loan facilities while also seeking to ensure that the Group\u2019s cost of debt remains competitive. The policy aims to protect the Group\u2019s earnings from the volatility in interest rates and provide stability to Unitholders\u2019 returns.\nCash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of the changes in market interest rates. The Group\u2019s and Trust\u2019s exposure to cash flow interest rate risks arise mainly from variable rate financial liabilities. The Manager manages the cash flow interest rate risks of these variable rate financial liabilities using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps or via fixed rates borrowings.\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Group had interest rate swap contracts with total notional amounts of $172.0 million and AUD478.5 million, equivalent to approximately $426.6 million (31 March 2022: $202.0 million and AUD478.5 million, equivalent to approximately $484.8 million). For the interest rate swap contracts, the Group had agreed with counterparties to exchange at specified intervals, the difference between the floating rates pegged to the SORA or BBSY (31 March 2022: SOR, SORA or BBSY) and fixed rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.\nManaging interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks\nA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as \u201cinterest rate benchmark reform).\nThe Group\u2019s main IBOR exposure in previous year was indexed to SOR. In Singapore, the Steering Committee for SOR and SIBOR transition to SORA (SC-STS) together with the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee (SFEMC), has recommended the discontinuation of SOR and a shift towards the use of SORA as the alternative interest rate benchmark in Singapore. The timeline for SORA to replace SOR is by the end of June 2023.\nAs at 31 March 2022, the Group had exposures to SOR on its financial instruments that has been replaced with SORA subsequently. As at 31 March 2023, the Group has no remaining IBOR exposure.\n", "\n\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended 31 March 2023\n26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (cont\u2019d)\n(c) Market risk (cont\u2019d)\n(i) Interest rate risk (cont\u2019d)\nExposure to interest rate risk\nAt the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Group\u2019s and Trust\u2019s interest-bearing financial instruments was as follows:\nGroup Trust\nNominal amount Nominal amount\n2023 $\u2019000 2022 $\u2019000 2023 $\u2019000 2022 $\u2019000\nFixed rate instruments\n\nFinancial liabilities | (100,000) | (100,000) | (100,000) | (100,000)\nInterest rate swaps   1 | (598,631) | (686,768) | (343,633) | (397,022)\n | (698,631) | (786,768) | (443,633) | (497,022)\nVariable rate instruments\n\nFinancial liabilities | (695,967) | (758,922) | (292,882) | (309,236)\nInterest rate swaps   1 | 598,631 | 686,768 | 343,633 | 397,022\n | (97,336) | (72,154) | 50,751 | 87,786\n1 Including forward interest rate swaps.\nSensitivity analysis\nA change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/ (decreased) the total return and Unitholders\u2019 funds by the amounts shown below.

When it is probable that the total development costs will exceed the total projected revenue, the amount in excess of net realisable value is recognised as an expense immediately. The process of evaluating the net realisable value of each property is subject to management judgement and the effect of assumptions in respect of development plans, timing of sale and the prevailing market conditions. Management performs cost studies for each property, taking into account the costs incurred to date, the development status and costs to complete each development property. Any future variation in plans, assumptions and estimates can potentially impact the carrying amounts of the respective properties.\nThe allowance for foreseeable losses involves significant judgement and estimates and was determined taking into consideration the expected selling prices for the projects, which were estimated based on external independent professional valuation undertaken and management\u2019s judgement and estimates on expected future selling prices to derive the net realisable value as disclosed above. The valuation was undertaken by an independent professional valuer who has appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the development properties being valued. The valuation was based on the comparable sales method. The valuation method used involves making estimates of the selling prices of the development properties, taking into consideration the recent selling prices for comparable properties and prevailing property market conditions as at reporting date. Management\u2019s estimation of future selling prices meanwhile, takes into account the recent sales price trend information of the development, local market conditions and sales strategies. Market conditions may, however, change which may affect the estimated future selling prices and accordingly, the carrying value of development properties may have to be adjusted in future periods.\nThe allowance for foreseeable losses on development properties recognised/(written back) is included in \u201cother operating income\u201d.\n9 CONTRACT COSTS\nThe amount relates to commission fees incurred to property agents for securing sale contracts for the Group\u2019s development properties.

The ARC members bring with them invaluable professional expertise in the accounting and financial management domains.

The Board, after considering the advice from the NC, believes that the ARC members are appropriately qualified to discharge the ARC\u2019s responsibilities as defined under its written terms of reference which have been approved by the Board.\nThe ARC does not comprise any former partners or directors of the Company\u2019s existing auditing firm or auditing corporation.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nThe ARC had reviewed the external auditors\u2019 audit plan for FY2023 and had agreed with the auditors\u2019 proposed significant areas of focus and assumptions that impact the financial statements. In the ARC\u2019s review of the financial statements of the Group for FY2023, the ARC had discussed with the Management the accounting principles that were applied and their judgement of items that could affect the integrity of the financial statements and also considered the clarity of key disclosures in the financial statements. The ARC also reviewed and addressed, amongst other matters, the following key audit matter as reported by the external auditors for FY2023:\n\n\u2022\nImpairment of Plant and Equipment and Right-of-Use Assets\nThe ARC acknowledges that the impairment of Plant and Equipment (\u201cPE\u2019) involves significant judgement. Towards this end, the ARC had developed a set of indicators to guide reviews and decisions on possible impairment to PE. The ARC undertakes a review on this basis, as supported with the Management\u2019s documentations and justifications, as and when necessary during the course of the year.\nThe PE was also an area of focus by the external auditors. The external auditors have included this item as a key audit matter in its audit report for FY2023. Please refer to page 100 of this Annual Report.\nThe ARC has considered the approach and methodology applied on the impairment assessment. Following the review and discussion with the Management and the external auditors, the ARC is satisfied that the impairment charge has been adequately provided for in FY2023.\nManagement reported to and discussed with the ARC on changes to the accounting standards and accounting issues which have a direct impact on the financial statements. Directors had also been invited to attend relevant seminars on changes to accounting standards and issues by leading accounting firms.\nFollowing the review, the ARC is satisfied that all the aforesaid matters have been properly dealt with and recommended the Board to approve the financial statements. The Board had on 26 June 2023 approved the financial statements.\nThe ARC had explicit authority to investigate any matter within its terms of reference and is given the task to commission independent investigations into matters where there is suspected fraud or irregularity, or failure of internal controls or infringement of any laws, rules or regulations, which has or is likely to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operating results or financial position, and to review the findings thereof. The ARC has full access to, and the co-operation of the Management, and also the discretion to invite any Director or any member of the Management to attend its meetings. The ARC has adequate resources, including access to external consultants and auditors, to enable it to discharge its responsibilities properly.\nIndependence of External Auditors\nThe ARC oversees the Group\u2019s relationship with its external auditors. It reviews the selection of the external auditors and recommends to the Board the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditors, the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors. The annual re-appointment of the external auditors is subject to Shareholders\u2019 approval at each AGM of the Company.\nThe ARC also reviews the scope and value of non-audit services provided by the Company\u2019s external auditors, CLA Global TS Public Accounting Corporation, through discussions with the external auditors and an annual review of the nature, extent and charges of non- audit services provided by the external auditors to the Group as part of the ARC\u2019s assessment of independence of the external auditors. The relevant details are set out in the table below. The ARC is of the view that the non-audit services provided by the external auditors during FY2023 did not prejudice their objectivity and independence. The ARC has therefore recommended to the Board the nomination of CLA Global TS Public Accounting Corporation for re-appointment as auditors of the Company at the forthcoming AGM.\n", "CORPORAT E\nGOVERNAN C E R E P O R T\nA breakdown of the fees paid to the Group\u2019s external auditors (including its associated firms) are disclosed in the table below:\nExternal Auditors' Fees for FY2023 $\u2019000 % of Total Fees\n\nTotal Audit Fees | 96 | 78\nTotal Non-Audit Fees | 27 | 22\nTotal Fees Paid | 123 | 100\nThe Company confirms that the Group has complied with Rules 712 and 715 of the Catalist Rules in relation to the appointment of its external auditors.\nWhistle Blowing Policy\nTo encourage proper work ethics and eradicate any internal improprieties, unethical acts, malpractices, fraudulent acts, corruption and/ or criminal activities in the Group, the Company has put in place a whistle blowing policy (\u201cWhistle Blowing Policy\u201d). The Whistle Blowing Policy provides the mechanism by which concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters may be raised by employees of the Group. A Whistle-Blowing Committee (\u201cWBC\u201d) has been established for this purpose. In addition, a dedicated and secured e-mail address also allows whistle blowers to contact the WBC and members of the ARC directly.\nAssisted by the WBC, the ARC reviews all whistle-blowing complaints, if any, at each ARC meeting to ensure independent, thorough investigations and appropriate follow-up actions.

Not only is this project the world\u2019s largest implementation of Esri Utility Network, it also achieves real-time management and promotes superior network resilience, while being ready to support future energy integration of renewable energy sources: hydro, solar, wind and thermal.\nA Commitment to People Development\nGiven how important geospatial technology has become to data analytics underpinning everything from smart cities to Internet of Things to climate change, promising long- term prospects abound for the sector. Yet, I cannot help but feel that our Geospatial Division\u2019s growth has not matched up with our expectations and more can be done to help the division to achieve a quantum leap to success.\nThe global geospatial sector now faces the challenge of a lack of skilled talent. Customer requirements have become increasingly complex and a capable workforce is needed to keep pace with this change. While there will be growth factors for the sector, a lack of talent will be an impediment to realising its fullest growth potential. Despite the obvious strong demand for geospatial talent, there is no education institution so far that specifically provides geospatial education and training in the Asia Pacific where we operate. This has motivated us to work together with the University of New South Wales (\u201cUNSW\u201d) to develop a geospatial innovation and learning centre that links training to high-impact industry research. We are glad to be partnering with UNSW in this meaningful endeavour, sharing in a commitment to ensuring the long-term success of the industry. Our subsidiary, Esri Australia, a dominant player in the Asia Pacific, is equally committed to driving technological innovation and promoting workforce development together with UNSW.\nOur people have been our greatest asset and the driving force behind our success. This year, I am happy to share that Boustead has, for the third time, been recognised as one of Singapore\u2019s best employers in an extensive survey conducted by Statista and The Straits Times, placing 5th in our category and 155th overall. Separately, Boustead Projects was also awarded the SkillsFuture Employer Award (Gold), an honour given to exemplary employers who are strong advocates of continuous learning and supporters of national manpower objectives.\nA Step Towards a Reunited Boustead Group\nWhen we take a look back at our enduring heritage of close to two centuries, it is clear that Boustead is no stranger to change, having been seasoned by the challenges of wars, economic depressions and recessions, pandemics and the inevitable passage of time. Where we are today can be attributed to an ability to embrace change and adapt to evolving times \u2013 attributes that are key to our longevity.\nIn 2015, we distributed Boustead Projects\u2019 shares as a dividend-in- specie and separately listed Boustead Projects for many good reasons. However, over the past eight years, the circumstances and support to separately list Boustead Projects have changed significantly, just like how the business and geopolitical environment have evolved. Increasing compliance and regulatory requirements have mounted on listed corporations over the years, which have led to significant costs, effort and time being expended. The current structure of two separately listed entities has also resulted in a smaller market capitalisation for each, lowering our visibility and limiting our ability to attract sizeable shareholders and to reflect our true value.\n\nThese changes have spurred us to call\nfor a simplified structure that allows\nfor greater control and flexibility in\nthe use of business resources and for\nmanagement to focus on rebuilding the\nbusiness post-pandemic without the\nshortcomings of having two separately\nlisted entities. In February 2023, we launched a voluntary unconditional general offer to consolidate our effective interest in Boustead Projects. Our effective interest in Boustead Projects increased from 54% at the end of FY2022 to 75.5% at the end of FY2023. As a sign that our offer was well received, an overwhelming 82% of available shares was acquired through open market transactions and acceptances at the offer price, which translated to about S$61 million being used to acquire almost 21% of shareholding in Boustead Projects.\nOur intention to delist and privatise Boustead Projects still remains a work in progress. We thank you for your continued support in this and your patience as we explore various options to reach our goal, a reunited Boustead Group that will stand stronger and infuse the progressive agility to withstand the complexities of our evolving world.\nA Word of Appreciation\nI would like to express my deepest gratitude to our management and staff around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions. The past few years have not been an easy time for many, and our steadfast performance has demonstrated the commitment of our team members in the face of adversity.\nI would also like to thank our key stakeholders \u2013 clients, business partners, associates, bankers, suppliers, government agencies and you, our fellow shareholders \u2013 for your continuous support. I look forward to reconnecting with you in person at our upcoming Annual General Meeting.\nFinally, I wish you and your loved ones, good health and peace.

FKT in its review report had identified 7 entities (\u201cIdentified Entities\u201d) that were suspected interested person transactions (\u201cIPT\u201d) and therefore breached certain Catalist Rules.\nBased on the review report, FKT had noted that the breaches of the Catalist Rules did not arise from a breach of the Company\u2019s internal controls relating to IPT. Instead, the breaches arose due to non-disclosure by Mr. Koh of his relationships with the 7 Identified Entities. CAD has on January 27, 2021 issued an order to the Company pursuant to Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2012 Revised Edition) to produce certain documents and information in relation to offences under the Penal Code (Cap.224) and the Securities and Futures Act (Cap.289) pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Code for financial years ended September 30, 2015 to 2020.

However, the Group did not eliminate such financial guarantee liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as at September 30, 2021 where the underlying debts from the banking facilities were consolidated. The impact of this adjustment for the year ended September 30, 2021 decrease losses for the year and accumulated losses by $4,308,000. The Group\u2019s financial guarantee liabilities has been restated accordingly.\n(b) Restatement of inventories\nOne of the Group\u2019s subsidiary, SMCI, did not capitalise cost of conversion of inventories as at September 30, 2021. Management has subsequently recomputed the costs of inventories conversion and quantified approximately $379,000 of such costs to be capitalised into finished goods as at September 30, 2021. The impact of this adjustment for the year ended September 30, 2021 decrease losses for the year and accumulated losses by $379,000. The Group inventories has been restated accordingly.\n(c) Change in accounting policy \u2013 Property, plant and equipment\nDuring the financial year ended September 30, 2022, the Group\u2019s accounting policy with respect to the measurement of land and buildings, classified under property, plant and equipment, subsequent to initial recognition has been changed from revaluation model to cost model, and this voluntary change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively.\nPreviously under the revaluation model, land and buildings are initially recognised at cost; and freehold land is subsequently carried at revalued amount less accumulated impairment losses and buildings and leasehold land are subsequently carried at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Under the cost model, freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses; and buildings and leasehold land are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Freehold land is not depreciated under revaluation model or cost model. The above two methods of measurement are permitted by SFRS(I) 1-16\nProperty, Plant and Equipment.\nManagement is of the view that the future economic benefits from land and buildings that are held for continued use in the Group\u2019s business are realised through their use rather than through sale or rental, and revalued differences on land and buildings arising from revaluations do not impact the production capacity or reflect the operational results of the Group. Therefore, management considers that the cost model would provide more reliable and more relevant financial information of the Group\u2019s operations.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230925OTHRHMV0_Sen Yue Holdings Limited_20230925171340_00_AR_4Q_20220930.2.pdf", "page_number": [24, 27]}, {"question": "What is the fair value of the club membership at the financial position date?", "answer": "The fair value of the club membership at the financial position date is $1,650,000.", "raw_text": "What is the fair value of the club membership at the financial position date?\n###ANSWER:\nThe fair value of the club membership at the financial position date is $1,650,000.", "pages": ["NOTES TO TH E\nFI NANCIAL STATEM EN TS\nFor the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2023\n23 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Group\n2023 $\u2019000 2022 $\u2019000\nTrademarks and franchise rights\nCost\n\nBeginning of financial year\nAdditions\nWritten-off\nEnd of financial year\n758 1,013\n\n72   \u2013\n(139) 691 (255) 758\nAccumulated amortisation and impairment loss\n\nBeginning of financial year\nAmortisation charge (Note 7)\nWritten-off\nEnd of financial year\n622 814\n\n62   63\n(139) 545 (255) 622\nNet book value\nEnd of financial year 146 136\nTrademarks and franchise rights pertain to the exclusive rights of brand names granted by franchisors to its subsidiary corporation, Bachmann Enterprises Pte.

The 10% sub-limit for non-pro rata share issues is lower than the 20% sub-limit allowed under the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST. The Company is seeking approval from shareholders for a lower sub-limit for non-pro rata share issues as it does not anticipate that it will require a higher sub-limit before the next Annual General Meeting. For the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares that may be issued, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) at the time that Ordinary Resolution 6 is passed, after adjusting for (a) new shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which were issued and are outstanding or subsisting at the time that Ordinary Resolution 6 is passed, and (b) any subsequent bonus issue or consolidation or subdivision of shares.\nOrdinary Resolution 7\nOrdinary Resolution 7 is to renew the mandate to enable the Company, its subsidiaries and associated companies that are entities at risk (as that term is used in Chapter 9), or any of them, to enter into certain interested person transactions with certain specified classes of interested persons as described in the Appendix to the Letter. Ordinary Resolution 7 will, if passed, continue to be in force until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.\nOrdinary Resolution 8\nOrdinary Resolution 8 is to renew the mandate to enable the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued Shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Resolution.\nThe Company intends to use internal and external sources of funds to finance its purchase or acquisition of Shares. The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire its Shares, and the impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on the number of Shares purchased or acquired, whether the purchase or acquisition is made out of profits or capital, the price at which such Shares were purchased or acquired and whether the Shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or cancelled.\nBased on the existing issued Shares of the Company as at 25 May 2023 (\u201cLatest Practicable Date\u201d) (out of which 25,349,477 Shares were held in treasury and no shares were held as subsidiary holdings as at the Latest Practicable Date), and assuming that on or prior to the Annual General Meeting, (i) no further Shares are issued, (ii) no further Shares are purchased or acquired, or held by the Company as treasury shares, (iii) no treasury shares are transferred out of treasury or cancelled, and (iv) no Shares are held as subsidiary holdings, the purchase by the Company of 10% of its issued Shares (excluding the 25,349,477 Shares held in treasury as at that date) will result in the purchase or acquisition of 224,974,004 Shares.\nIn the case of both market purchases and off-market purchases by the Company and assuming that the Company purchases or acquires the 224,974,004 Shares at the Maximum Price of S$0.495 for one Share (being the price equivalent to 5% above the average of the last dealt prices of the Shares for the five consecutive market days on which the Shares were traded on the SGX-ST immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required for the purchase or acquisition of the 224,974,004 Shares is S$111,362,132.\nThe financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such Shares by the Company pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the audited financial statements of the Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 based on these assumptions are set out in paragraph 3.7 of the Letter.\n", "Notes:\nFormat of Meeting\n1.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d)\n2.22 Leases\n(a) When the Group is the lessee:\nAt the inception of the contract, the Group assesses if the contract contains a lease. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Reassessment is only required when the terms and conditions of the contract are changed.\n\n\u2022\nRight-of-use assets\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the date which the underlying asset is available for use. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost which comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and lease incentive received. Any initial direct costs that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained are added to the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets.\nThese right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.\nRight-of-use assets (except for those which meets the definition of an investment property) are presented within \u201cRight-of-use assets\u201d.\nRight-of-use asset which meets the definition of an investment property is presented within \u201cInvestment properties\u201d and accounted for in accordance with Note 2.8.\n\n\u2022\nLease liabilities\nThe initial measurement of lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted using the implicit rate in the lease, if the rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group shall use its incremental borrowing rate.\nLease payments include the following:\n- Fixed payment (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivables;\n\n-\nVariable lease payment that are based on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n\n-   Amount expected to be payable under residual value guarantees;\n-   The exercise price of a purchase option if reasonably certain to exercise the option; and\n-\nPayment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.\nFor a contract that contains both lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease and non-lease component. The Group has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for property leases and account for these as one single lease component.\nLease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Lease liability shall be remeasured when:\n- There is a change in future lease payments arising from changes in an index or rate;\n\n-   There is a change in the Group\u2019s assessment of whether it will exercise an extension option; or\n-\nThere are modification in the scope or the consideration of the lease that was not part of the original term.\nLease liability is remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n", "Notes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d)\n2.22 Leases\n(a) When the Group is the lessee: (cont\u2019d)\n\n\u2022\nShort term and low value leases\nThe Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of 12 months or less and low value leases. Lease payments relating to these leases are expensed to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n\u2022\nVariable lease payments\nVariable lease payments that are not based on an index or a rate are not included as part of the measurement and initial recognition of the lease liability. The Group shall recognise those lease payments in profit or loss in the periods that triggered those lease payments.\n(b) When the Group is the lessor:\nThe Group leases out investment properties under operating leases and sub-leases its right-of-use of a leasehold land to non-related parties.\n\n\u2022\nLessor \u2013 Operating leases\nLeases where the Group retains substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating leases (net of any incentives given to the lessees) is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nInitial direct costs incurred by the Group in negotiating and arranging operating leases are added to the carrying amount of the leased assets and recognised as an expense in profit or loss over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.\nContingent rents are recognised as income in profit or loss when earned.\n\n\u2022\nLessor \u2013 Subleases\nIn classifying a sublease, the Group as an intermediate lessor classifies the sublease as a finance or an operating lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, rather than the underlying asset.\nWhen the sublease is assessed as a finance lease, the Group derecognises the right-of-use asset relating to the head lease that it transfers to the sublessee and recognises the net investment in the sublease within \u201cFinance lease receivables\u201d. Any differences between the right-of-use asset derecognised and the net investment in sublease is recognised in profit or loss. Lease liability relating to the head lease is retained in the balance sheet, which represents the lease payments owed to the head lessor.\nWhen the sublease is assessed as an operating lease, the Group recognises lease income from sublease in profit or loss within \u201cInterest income\u201d. The right-of-use asset relating to the head lease is not derecognised.\nFor a contract which contains lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis.\n", "Boustead Projects Limited\nAnnual Report 2023\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d)\n2.23 Share capital and treasury shares\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares are deducted against the share capital account.\nWhen any entity within the Group purchases the Company\u2019s ordinary shares (\u201ctreasury shares\u201d), the carrying amount which includes the consideration paid and any directly attributable transaction cost is presented as a component within equity attributable to the Company\u2019s equity holders, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\nWhen treasury shares are subsequently cancelled, the costs of treasury shares are deducted against the share capital account if the shares are purchased out of capital of the Company, or against the retained profits of the Company if the shares are purchased out of earnings of the Company.\nWhen treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued pursuant to an employee share award scheme, the cost of treasury shares is reversed from the treasury share account and the realised gain or loss on sale or reissue, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and related income tax, is recognised in the capital reserve.\n2.24 Dividends to the Company\u2019s shareholders\nDividends to the Company\u2019s shareholders are recognised when the dividends are approved for payment.\n2.25 Cash and cash equivalents\nFor the purpose of presentation in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and deposits with financial institutions which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n2.26 Segment reporting\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the senior management, whose members are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230705OTHROF7U_Boustead Projects Limited_20230705072347_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [105, 108]}, {"question": "What is the gearing ratio of Medtecs International Corporation Limited as of 31 December 2022?", "answer": "9.7%", "raw_text": "What is the gearing ratio of Medtecs International Corporation Limited as of 31 December 2022?\n###ANSWER:\n9.7%", "pages": ["\nMEDTECS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION LIMITED\n(Incorporated in Bermuda)\nAND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in United States dollars unless otherwise stated)\n32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)\nd) Credit risk (continued)\nCredit quality\nThe credit quality of the Group\u2019s financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired are considered to be of high grade quality and expected to be collectible without incurring any credit losses. High grade financial assets are those financial assets whose realisability is assured.\nFinancial assets (including sundry debtors and deposits) that are neither past due nor impaired are due from creditworthy debtors with good payment record with the Group. Cash and cash equivalents and fixed deposits are entered into with reputable financial institutions duly approved by the directors.\nInformation regarding financial assets that are either past due or impaired is disclosed in Note 14.\n33. FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\na) Fair value hierarchies\nThe Group categorises fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs used as follows:\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at\nthe measurement date;\nLevel 2 \u2013 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\nLevel 3 \u2013 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\nb) Financial instruments whose carrying amounts approximate fair values\nManagement has determined that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, fixed deposits, due from subsidiaries, trade receivables, other current assets, trade payables and other current liabilities and bank loans based on their notional amounts, reasonably approximate their fair values because these are mostly short-term in nature or are repriced frequently.\nc) Assets and Liabilities measured at fair value and for which fair values are disclosed\nThe following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group\u2019s assets.

In the past three years, the world endured multiple disruptions and lockdowns, while many grappled with the loss of lives and livelihoods. With the end of COVID-19 as a global health emergency during the past year, economies have reopened with a resurgence of business activities \u2013 a promising sign that the world has overcome the most challenging of times brought on by COVID-19.\nI am glad to see these positive sentiments also reflected in our Group\u2019s business performance for FY2023. While the Group\u2019s overall revenue was 11% lower year-on-year at S$561.6 million, net profit attributable to you \u2013 our fellow shareholders \ufffd\ufffd was 48% higher year-on-year at S$45.3 million.

Together with the interim dividend of 1.5 cents per share already paid, the total dividend of 4 cents per share matches that of FY2022 and equates to a dividend payout ratio of 42%.\nFY2023 \u2013 Progressive Agility\nAlthough the world is now in a better position exiting the pandemic, the past year has not been devoid of significant challenges for the Group, as the business environment continues to be plagued by high inflation, rising interest rates, volatile global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions. This year, the theme \u2018Progressive Agility\u2019 graces the cover of the Annual Report, representing the Group\u2019s adaptive mindset, resilience and agile posture to adapt to rapidly evolving circumstances. This mindset assumes that complexity, uncertainty and volatility can only be overcome where agility of mindset moves beyond formulaic approaches to truly comprehend the business context and design ecosystem solutions that readily benefit people and planet. Indeed, thanks to this mindset, the Group has prevailed over the challenges and delivered a credible performance for FY2023.\n#MOVED-TO-PREVIOUS-FLOW\nBenefitting from a cyclical upturn, the Energy Engineering Division enjoyed recovery in FY2023 following the post- pandemic reopening of borders and economies, and global demand for greater energy security. Riding on an improving outlook for the energy sector, the division captured S$164 million in new contracts, an amount more than that combined for FY2021 and FY2022. However, due to significantly lower order backlog carried forward at the end of FY2022 which impacted revenue contribution in the first half, the division\u2019s revenue and profit before income tax (\u201cPBT\u201d) for FY2023 were 13% and 4% lower year-on-year at S$98.0 million and S$15.2 million respectively. The full effects of recovery are expected to take place in FY2024.\nContinuing their position as the top revenue contributor, the Real Estate Division (Boustead Projects) saw an improvement in profitability as engineering & construction (\u201cE&C\u201d) business activities regained momentum with the lifting of pandemic restrictions. Boustead Projects\u2019 revenue in FY2023 was 16% lower year-on-year at S$284.0 million due to lower revenue contributions from a leaner order backlog carried forward at the end of FY2022. However, PBT improved 92% year-on-year to reach S$26.5 million, partially riding on better cost management, a one-off gain on disposal of a subsidiary (holding Boustead Industrial Park) to a joint venture in Vietnam and lower overhead expenses.\nBoustead Projects\u2019 E&C business turned the corner and returned to profitability from a loss position in the prior year. The award of a S$300 million E&C contract \u2013 Boustead Projects\u2019 largest on record \u2013 boosted their order backlog at the end of FY2023 to S$402 million. Two large projects secured pre-pandemic \u2013 JTC Kranji Green and Surbana Jurong Campus \u2013 were substantially completed, giving Boustead Projects a clean slate to focus on rebuilding their order backlog with high value-added sector projects. Nonetheless, high inflation, tight business conditions and greater competition are expected to create significant challenges for Boustead Projects going forward.\n", "\nBoustead Project\u2019s real estate business achieved higher occupancy and income despite the challenges of increasing interest rates and property expenses. Notable progress was made in asset class diversification, first with the acquisition of mixed development 28 & 30 Bideford Road at Singapore\u2019s prime Orchard Precinct and then with the secured partnership of COMO Group to establish COMO Orchard at the property. Boustead Projects also strategically diversified income streams geographically, through a strategic collaboration with Khai Toan Joint Stock Company (\u201cKTG\u201d) in Vietnam, under which Boustead Industrial Park was injected into the flagship KTG & Boustead Industrial Logistics Fund.\nAs demand for geospatial technology and smart mapping capabilities continued to hold firm, the Geospatial Division\u2019s revenue remained comparable year-on-year at S$168.0 million, while PBT was 4% lower year-on-year at S$35.4 million due to variations in revenue mix and exchange rate headwinds. The division\u2019s clients continued to utilise geospatial solutions as a foundational technology to recover from the pandemic and counter the challenges of a business landscape increasingly shaped by geopolitical tensions and climate concerns. The division also maintained a healthy deferred services backlog of S$92 million at the end of FY2023.\nDespite the easing of the pandemic, the Healthcare Division continued to be challenged by the lingering effects of the pandemic. Across the world, the priority given to addressing pandemic- related needs in the past three years has led to delays and disruptions in elective medical procedures and neglect of rehabilitative care and sports science solutions. In FY2023, steps to address the poor performance of the division included significant management changes, hiving off the loss-making sleep care business, shutting down the labour-intensive disinfection business and right-sizing the team for the current level of business activities. Admittedly, while our efforts to address the challenges have narrowed the loss in FY2023, the division still demands great effort to effectively turnaround the business and see meaningful returns.\nStrengthening Our Business \u2013 To Help Build A Better World Forward\nThe Group\u2019s steadfast performance in FY2023 will never be a reason for us to rest on our laurels but a reminder that we need to be well-prepared for more volatility ahead. We continue to refine our strategies, leverage market opportunities and optimise operational efficiencies to strengthen our business. While prioritising innovation and deepening existing domain expertise, we also continue to search for synergistic partnerships that will further enhance our capabilities and broaden revenue streams to drive long-term growth while creating sustainable shared socio-economic value for our key stakeholders.\nThe global energy sector is facing a \u2018trilemma\u2019 of concerns \u2013 one that demands a delicate balance between energy security, accessibility and environmental sustainability. Heightened concerns over high commodity prices and energy security, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, have accelerated the pace of the energy transition. On this note, our diversification efforts to move beyond the traditional oil & gas sector are beginning to bear fruits. Among such projects by Boustead International Heaters (\u201cBIH\u201d), our Energy Engineering Division\u2019s largest subsidiary, is an innovative project for the design and delivery of a thermal treatment system for a newly developed process that recycles end-of-life and hard-to-recycle plastic waste into chemical feedstock for the production of recycled plastic or other petrochemicals, contributing to a circular economy and thereby reducing environmental impacts. Since BIH\u2019s inception, they have secured contracts for 230 heat recovery systems which are expected to generate annual thermal energy recovery of 52.8 terawatt-hours, equivalent to reducing 86.5 million barrels of oil consumed or saving approximately S$4.8 billion in industrial gas tariffs.\nAs a leading provider of innovative real estate solutions, Boustead Projects continues to advance and shape Asia\u2019s landscape with smart, eco-sustainable and future-ready developments. In addition to driving construction and property technology \u2013 ConTech and PropTech \u2013 Boustead Projects is also working on fostering a data-driven culture to improve the quality and speed of decision- making through data and data visualisation, critical moves that will help to sharpen their competitive advantage and reduce reliance on labour. In FY2023, Boustead Projects completed JTC Kranji Green, Singapore\u2019s national landmark project for recycling waste streams, playing a role in advancing Singapore\u2019s vision of a circular economy and Zero Waste Master Plan. Boustead Projects also delivered Takeda Singapore Biologics Manufacturing Support Facility \u2013 their first ever Green Mark Platinum Positive Energy (\u201cGMP PE\u201d) Building and also Singapore\u2019s first GMP PE in the biomedical and pharmaceutical sector. Capable of operating without drawing electricity from the national grid, this project is a hallmark of technology adoption, with 95% of its construction documentation and processes digitalised \u2013 a rare feat in Singapore\u2019s real estate sector.\nSeparately, Boustead Projects undertook the rigorous EcoVadis sustainability assessment and achieved a Silver EcoVadis Medal, ranking Boustead Projects in the 88th percentile for sustainability among rated corporations globally. EcoVadis is not only the world\u2019s largest and most trusted provider of business sustainability ratings with a global network of more than 100,000 corporations rated across over 200 sectors and 175 countries but is also used as the cornerstone of over 1,000 sustainable procurement programmes of multinational corporations.\nThe Geospatial Division delivered the implementation of a 3D digital twin of Australia\u2019s largest energy infrastructure network for Energy Queensland (\u201cEQ\u201d).

The Board also monitors the Group\u2019s exposure to various risk elements and externally imposed requirements by closely adhering to clearly established management policies and procedures.\nThe Group is subjected to the aggregate leverage limit as defined in the Appendix 6 of the CIS Code (the \u201cProperty Funds Appendix\u201d). The Property Funds Appendix stipulates the aggregate leverage of a property fund should not exceed 50% of the fund\u2019s deposited property if the property fund met the minimum adjusted interest coverage ratio of 2.5 times. In the event if the adjusted interest coverage ratio is below 2.5 times, the aggregate leverage of a property fund should not exceed 45% of the fund\u2019s deposited property.\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Group\u2019s aggregate leverage ratio 2.9 times), respectively. The Group had complied with the aggregate leverage limit during the financial year. was 36.1% (31 March 2022: 37.5%) and its interest coverage 1 and adjusted interest coverage ratio were 3.8 times (31 March 2022: 5.1 times) and 2.3 times (31 March 2022: 2 2\nThere were no changes in the Group\u2019s approach to capital management during the financial year.\nRisk management framework\nExposure to credit, interest rate, liquidity and foreign currency risks arises in the normal course of the Group\u2019s business. The Group has a system of controls in place to create an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks. The Manager continually monitors the Group\u2019s risk management process to ensure an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group\u2019s activities.\nThe Manager monitors compliance with the Group\u2019s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.\n(a) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from the failure of a tenant to settle its financial and contractual obligations to the Group, as and when they fall due.\nTrade receivables\nCredit evaluations are performed by the Manager before lease agreements are entered into with the tenants. Rental deposits as a multiple of monthly rent are received either in cash or bank guarantees to reduce credit risk. The Manager also monitors the amount owing by the tenants on an ongoing basis.\nBased on historical default rates, the Manager believes that no additional impairment allowance is necessary in respect of the remaining trade receivables as these receivables mainly arose from tenants that have good credit standing with the Group and the Group has sufficient security deposits as collateral.\nConcentration of credit risk relating to trade receivables is limited due to the Group\u2019s varied tenant profile and credit policy of obtaining security deposits, banker\u2019s guarantees or other forms of collateral from tenants.\nThe aggregate leverage includes lease liabilities that are entered into in the ordinary course of AA REIT's business on or after 1 April 2019 in accordance to MAS guidelines. The interest coverage ratio (\u201cICR\u201d) is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (excluding effects of any fair value changes of derivatives and investment properties, and foreign exchange translation), by the trailing 12 months interest expense and borrowing-related fees. The adjusted ICR includes the amount reserved for distribution to Perpetual Securities holders in the interest expense. The ICR and adjusted ICR excluded interest expense on lease liabilities. 1 2\n", "\n\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended 31 March 2023\n26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (cont\u2019d)\n(a) Credit risk (cont\u2019d)\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and fixed deposits are placed with financial institutions which are regulated.\nImpairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. The ECL on cash and cash equivalents is negligible.\nDerivatives\nTransactions involving derivative financial instruments are entered only with bank counterparties that are regulated.\nLoan to joint venture\nThe Group extended a loan to a joint venture to fund the capital expenditure requirement in relation to Optus Centre. Based on an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of the risk of default, the exposure is considered to be of low credit risk. Therefore, the Manager believes that no impairment allowance is necessary as at 31 March 2023.\nOther receivables\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECLs associated with financial assets at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. The Group considers that the credit risk of these counterparties have not increased, and determines that the 12-month ECL on outstanding balances is negligible as at 31 March 2023.\nExposure to credit risk\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.\nThe ageing of the trade and other receivables at the reporting date was as follows:\n\n | Impairment |  | Impairment\nGross | losses | Gross | losses\n2023 | 2023 | 2022 | 2022\n$\u2019000 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000 | $\u2019000\nGroup\n\nNot past due | 4,901 | \u2013 | 5,384 | \u2013\nPast due 1 \u2013 30 days | 450 | \u2013 | 138 | \u2013\nPast due 31 \u2013 90 days | 22 | \u2013 | 87 | \u2013\nPast due more than 90 days | 24 | \u2013 | 11 | \u2013\n | 5,397 | \u2013 | 5,620 | \u2013\nTrust\n\nNot past due | 4,836 | \u2013 | 7,362 | \u2013\nPast due 1 \u2013 30 days | 450 | \u2013 | 138 | \u2013\nPast due 31 \u2013 90 days | 22 | \u2013 | 87 | \u2013\nPast due more than 90 days | 24 | \u2013 | 11 | \u2013\n | 5,332 | \u2013 | 7,598 | \u2013\n", "\n\nNOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended 31 March 2023\n26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (cont\u2019d)\n(b) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Trust will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group\u2019s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group\u2019s reputation.\nThe Manager monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by the Manager to finance the Group\u2019s operations and to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in cash flows. Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a reasonable period, including the servicing of financial obligations.\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Group has unutilised committed credit facilities amounting to $169.1 million (31 March 2022: $160.4 million).\nThe Group also monitors and observes the Property Funds Appendix issued by the MAS concerning limits on total borrowings.\nThe Group has bank loans which contain certain covenants. Any breach of covenants may require the Group to repay the loans earlier than indicated in note 10.\nThe following are the expected contractual undiscounted cash inflows/(outflows) of financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements:\nContractual cash flows\nCarrying Less than 1 to 5 More than\namount Total 1 year $\u2019000 years 5 years Group $\u2019000 $\u2019000 $\u2019000 $\u2019000\n2023 Non-derivative financial liabilities\n\nMedium term notes | (99,762)   (107,210) | (3,600) | (103,610) | \u2013\nBank borrowings | (691,226)   (804,146) | (33,472) | (770,674) | \u2013\nTrade and other payables   1   Liabilities directly associated with   the investment property held | (50,112)   (50,112) | (35,011) | (12,316) | (2,785)\nfor sale | (253)   (259) | (259) | \u2013 | \u2013\nLease liabilities | (98,098)   (140,485) | (8,794) | (29,515) | (102,176)\n | (939,451) (1,102,212) | (81,136) | (916,115) | (104,961)\nDerivative financial instruments Non-current assets Interest rate swaps (net-settled)\n\n\u2013 designated as cash flow hedge | 12,064 | 11,578 | 6,160 | 5,418 | \u2013\nCurrent assets Interest rate swaps (net-settled)\n\n\u2013 designated as cash flow hedge   Currency forward contracts   (net-settled) | 939 | 1,151 | 1,151 | \u2013 | \u2013\n\u2013 at FVTPL | 232 | 217 | 217 | \u2013 | \u2013\nCurrent liabilities Currency forward contracts (net-settled)\n\n\u2013 at FVTPL | (\u2013*) | (1) | (1) | \u2013 | \u2013\n | 13,235 | 12,945 | 7,527 | 5,418 | \u2013\n1 Excluding rental received in advance. less than $1,000. *\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230622OTHRHMBI_Aims Apac Reit Management Limited_20230622071630_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [72, 75]}, {"question": "What is the maximum exposure to credit risk based on the Group\u2019s credit policy as of 31 March 2023?", "answer": "HK$6,589,302,000", "raw_text": "What is the maximum exposure to credit risk based on the Group\u2019s credit policy as of 31 March 2023?\n###ANSWER:\nHK$6,589,302,000", "pages": ["\nNotes to Financial Statements (Continued)\n\u8ca1\u52d9\u5831\u8868\u9644\u8a3b\uff08\u7e8c\uff09\n31 March 2023 2023\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\n44.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and\nPolicies\nThe Group\u2019s principal financial instruments comprise bank and other borrowings, senior notes, medium-term notes, domestic company bonds and cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group\u2019s operations. The Group has various other financial assets such as trade receivables, which arise directly from its operations.\nThe main risks arising from the Group\u2019s financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarized below.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group\u2019s borrowings. The interest rates and terms of repayment of the Group\u2019s borrowings are disclosed in notes 29, 30, 31 and 32 to the financial statements. The Group\u2019s policy is to obtain the most favourable interest rates available for its borrowings.\nThe Group constantly assesses the interest rate risk it encounters to decide whether it is required to hedge against the possible interest rate risk that may arise.\nOn 31 March 2023, if the interest rate of bank borrowings had increased/decreased by 0.5% and all other factors remained unchanged, the profit after tax for the year of the Group would have decreased/increased by approximately HK$7,561,000 (2022: HK$39,348,000).\n45. \u8ca1\u52d9\u98a8\u96aa\u7ba1\u7406\u76ee\u6a19\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\n\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u4e3b\u8981\u91d1\u878d\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u62ec\u9280\u884c\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u501f\u8cb8\u3001\u512a\n\n\u5148\u7968\u64da\u3001\u4e2d\u671f\u7968\u64da\u3001\u5883\u5167\u516c\u53f8\u50b5\u5238\u53ca\u73fe\u91d1\u53ca\u77ed\n\u671f\u5b58\u6b3e\u3002\u8a72\u7b49\u91d1\u878d\u5de5\u5177\u4e3b\u8981\u70ba\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u696d\u52d9\u7c4c\u96c6\n\u8cc7\u91d1\u3002\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u4ea6\u64c1\u6709\u591a\u9805\u5176\u4ed6\u91d1\u878d\u8cc7\u7522\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\n\u76f4\u63a5\u5f9e\u696d\u52d9\u71df\u904b\u7522\u751f\u7684\u61c9\u6536\u8cbf\u6613\u8cec\u6b3e\u3002\n\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u91d1\u878d\u5de5\u5177\u6240\u7522\u751f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u98a8\u96aa\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7387\u98a8\n\n\u96aa\u3001\u4fe1\u8cb8\u98a8\u96aa\u3001\u6d41\u52d5\u8cc7\u91d1\u98a8\u96aa\u53ca\u5916\u532f\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u8463\n\u4e8b\u6703\u5c0d\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5404\u9805\u98a8\u96aa\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u9032\u884c\u6aa2\u8a0e\u53ca\u5354\n\u5b9a\uff0c\u8a72\u7b49\u98a8\u96aa\u6982\u8ff0\u5982\u4e0b\u3002\n\u5229\u7387\u98a8\u96aa\n\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u9762\u81e8\u7684\u5229\u7387\u98a8\u96aa\u4e3b\u8981\u8207\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u7684\u501f\u8cb8\u76f8\n\n\u95dc\u3002\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u501f\u8cb8\u7684\u5229\u7387\u53ca\u9084\u6b3e\u671f\u65bc\u8ca1\u52d9\u5831\u8868\u9644\n\u8a3b29\u300130\u300131\u53ca32\u4e2d\u62ab\u9732\u3002\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u662f\u70ba\n\u5176\u501f\u8cb8\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u6709\u5229\u7684\u5229\u7387\u3002\n\u672c\u96c6\u5718\u5c07\u6301\u7e8c\u8a55\u4f30\u6240\u9047\u5230\u7684\u5229\u7387\u98a8\u96aa\u4ee5\u6c7a\u5b9a\u662f\n\n\u5426\u9700\u8981\u5c0d\u6c96\u53ef\u80fd\u7522\u751f\u7684\u5229\u7387\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\n\u65bc2023\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\uff0c\u5018\u9280\u884c\u501f\u8cb8\u7684\u5229\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u2571\n\n\u4e0b\u964d0.5%\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u8b8a\uff0c\u5247\u672c\u96c6\u5718\n\u672c\u5e74\u5ea6\u7a05\u5f8c\u5229\u6f64\u5c07\u6703\u6e1b\u5c11\u2571\u589e\u52a0\u7d047,561,000\u6e2f\n\u5143\uff082022\u5e74\uff1a39,348,000\u6e2f\u5143\uff09\u3002\n", "\nNotes to Financial Statements (Continued)\n\u8ca1\u52d9\u5831\u8868\u9644\u8a3b\uff08\u7e8c\uff09\n31 March 2023 2023\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\n45.

The selection and application of audit procedures depends on the auditor\u2019s judgment.\n\uf09e Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control.\n\uf09e Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\nConclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\uf09e Evaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the financial statements are in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\nWe communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan\nWe do not have any interest in the Company which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan.\nNotes to the Reader of Audit Report:\nThe Independent Auditor\u2019s Report herein is the English translation of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.\n", "Liabilities\n\nCurrent liabilities   Short-term borrowings   Current portion of bonds payable   Accrued expenses   Borrowings secured by securities   Income taxes payable   Provision for bonuses   Other current liabilities   Total current liabilities   Non-current liabilities   Bonds payable   Long-term borrowings   Deferred tax liabilities   Other   Total non-current liabilities   Total liabilities\nNet assets   Shareholders\u2019 equity   Share capital   Capital surplus   Legal capital surplus   Total capital surplus   Retained earnings   Legal retained earnings   Other retained earnings   Reserve for tax purpose reduction entry   Retained earnings brought forward   Total retained earnings   Treasury shares   Deposits for subscriptions of treasury shares   Total shareholders\u2019 equity   Valuation and translation adjustments   Valuation difference on available-for-sale securities   Deferred gains or losses on hedges   Total valuation and translation adjustments   Share acquisition rights   Total net assets\nTotal liabilities and net assets\nAs of March 31, 2022\n83,623 *1\n240,390\n\n5,118\n*1\n47,747 765 *1\n1,074 2,143\n*1\n380,863\n684,597 494,201\n*1\n9,426 8,358\n*1\n1,196,584 1,577,447\n247,397\n226,751 226,751\n45,335\n\n448,895   1,860\n447,035 494,230\n(134,201) 26\n\n834,205\n30,373 (1,190) 29,182\n\n9,109   872,497\n2,449,944\n(Millions of yen)\nAs of March 31, 2023\n92,806 *1\n134,000\n\n3,722\n*1\n38,366 815 *1\n798\n\n7,188\n*1\n277,697\n643,382 529,335\n*1\n9,939\n\n11,581\n*1\n1,194,238 1,471,936\n247,397\n226,751 226,751\n45,335\n\n360,534   1,860\n358,674 405,870 (71,522)\n\n\u2013\n808,497\n30,605 (2,135) 28,469\n\n8,793   845,760\n2,317,696\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230919OTHRHAIP_Daiwa Securities Co., Ltd._20230919121938_00_AR_4Q_20230331.1.pdf", "page_number": [21, 24]}, {"question": "Who is the Share Registrar for Micro-Mechanics (Holdings) Ltd.?", "answer": "M & C Services Private Limited", "raw_text": "Who is the Share Registrar for Micro-Mechanics (Holdings) Ltd.?\n###ANSWER: M & C Services Private Limited", "pages": ["MICRO-MECHANICS (HOLDINGS) LTD.\n(Incorporated in the Republic of Singapore)\n(Company Registration No: 199604632W)\nPROXY FORM\nThis proxy form has been made available on SGXNET and the Company\u2019s website at https://micromechanics.listedcompany.com/.

The Group\u2019s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group\u2019s reputation.\nThe Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and bank balances deemed adequate by management to finance the Group\u2019s operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses, including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.\nThe Company\u2019s management operates a centralised cash and treasury function and monitors the cashflow position of the Company and its entities within the Group and deploys its available cash amongst these entities to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. There is no implication to the Group which reported net current assets of RMB240.8 million (2021 \u2013 RMB236.0 million) as at 31 December 2022.\nExposure to liquidity risk\nThe following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.

See further details in Note China against its contractor, China Huadian Engineering Co., Ltd,\n\n15B.\nOn 23 December 2017, the decisions of the arbitral tribunal (the \u201c2017 arbitration award\u201d) were as\nfollows:\n(i) Hua Dian is to abide by the EPC Contract and deliver to CEBEC a CEBEC plant in accordance with the technical specifications set out thereunder, within 6 months from 23 December 2017;\n(ii) Hua Dian\u2019s counter-claim in the amount of RMB31,657,659 (approximately $6,299,000) (the\n\u201cRemainder Amount\u201d), representing the unpaid amounts under the EPC Contract, is in abeyance until delivery of a CEBEC plant compliant with the technical specifications as laid out in the EPC Contract; and\nto perform the EPC contract, which shall be set-off against the Remainder Amount.\nOn 26 July 2018, CEBEC applied to the Beijing Court to enforce the 2017 arbitration award as Hua Dian failed to deliver a plant in accordance to the technical specifications within 6 months from 23 December 2017.

CEBEC sought for the dispute to be resolved at the Weifang Arbitration Commission despite obtaining an earlier arbitration award due to Hua Dian\u2019s insistence for payments of the remaining contract sum before carrying out\nany rectification work at the plant and the lack of specific definition in the EPC contract of a up to standard biomass power plant. The claims were as follows:\n(a) The EPC contract signed between Hua Dian and CEBEC be nullified or voided;\n(b) Hua Dian was responsible to reinstate the land where the CEBEC Plant is located to its original\n\ncondition by removing all equipment and machinery relating to the CEBEC Plant within 90 days\nfrom the date of the arbitration award;\n(c) Hua Dian was obliged to refund the contract sum paid by CEBEC under the EPC contract and\nexpenses paid on behalf of Hua Dian by CEBEC amounting to RMB148,326,885 (approximately $29,600,000) and RMB2,577,957 (approximately $515,000) respectively;\n(d) Hua Dian was required to compensate CEBEC for operating losses amounting to RMB41,259,848\nmillion (approximately $8,200,000); and\n(e) Hua Dian was required to bear the cost of arbitration.\n"], "pdf_name": "SG230930OTHRNKYQ_Ecowise Holdings Limited_20230930034342_00_AR_4Q_20230430.1.pdf", "page_number": [18, 21]}, {"question": "What is the name of the Group\u2019s first Korean concept restaurant?", "answer": "BBQ Seoul Shokudo", "raw_text": "What is the name of the Group\u2019s first Korean concept restaurant?\n###ANSWER:\nBBQ Seoul Shokudo", "pages": ["OUR\nBRANDS\nMENYA MUSASHI\nNamed Miyamoto Musashi, who was famed for his distinctive \u201cdouble sword style\u201d, the award winning \u201cMenya Musashi\u201d has gained quite a cult following among ramen fans in Japan and abroad since making its debut in Tokyo in 1996.
