(\u201cFY2023\u201d).\nRESULTS HIGHLIGHT\nEven though FY2023 is regarded as a global recovery year for organizations, it was a dissimilar situation for Samurai 2K Aerosol. The revenue of Samurai 2K Aerosol recorded a significant decline by 37.8% from MYR 113.04 million in FY2022 to MYR 70.27 million in FY2023. The decline in revenue was primarily due to the drop in sale in Malaysia and Indonesia markets. Other factors include increase in raw materials, packing materials and ocean freight cost resulting in lower gross profit margin. As a result, the Group incurred a net loss of MYR 11.45 million in FY2023 compared to FY2022 wherein total profit of MYR13.12 million was recorded.CORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE REPORT\n\nRULES   CATALIST   AND | maintaining   transparency,   to   greater   committed   ensure   is   \u201cGroup\u201d)   to   as\n2018   GOVERNANCE   CORPORATE   OF   CODE   THE   TO   COMPLIANCE   IN   REPORT   ANNUAL   FOR   TABLE   DISCLOSURE | so   the   systems   subsidiaries,   and   processes   its   with   together   governance   and   \u201cCompany\u201d   corporate   (the   its   on   Limited   importance   value.

Rationale for the Share Purchase Mandate\nThe Share Purchase Mandate authorising the Company to purchase or acquire its ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\u201cShares\u201d) would give the Company the flexibility to undertake share purchases or acquisitions up to the limit described in Section 4 below at any time, subject to market conditions, during the period when the Share Purchase Mandate is in force. The rationale for the Share Purchase Mandate includes the following:\n\n(a)\nThe Share Purchase Mandate would provide the Company with a mechanism to facilitate the return of surplus cash over and above its ordinary capital requirements and investment needs to its Shareholders in an expedient and cost-efficient manner.\n(b) The purchase or acquisition of Shares under the Share Purchase Mandate is one of the ways in which the return on equity of the Company may be enhanced, thereby increasing Shareholders\u2019 value.APPENDIX\n(c) The Share Purchase Mandate will allow the Directors to exercise greater control over the Company\u2019s share capital structure, dividend policy and cash reserves, with a view to enhancing the net tangible assets and/or earnings per Share.\n\n(d)\nThe purchase or acquisition of Shares under the Share Purchase Mandate will help to mitigate short-term share price volatility by stabilising the supply and demand of issued Shares and offset the effects of short- term share price speculation, thereby supporting the fundamental value of the issued Shares and bolstering Shareholders\u2019 confidence. (e) The Share Purchase Mandate will allow the Directors to effectively manage and minimise any dilution impact associated with any share-based incentive scheme of the Company.\nThe purchase or acquisition of Shares will only be undertaken if the Directors believe that it can benefit the Company and Shareholders. Shareholders should note that purchases or acquisitions of Shares pursuant to the Share Purchase Mandate may not be carried out to the full 10% limit as authorised. No purchase or acquisition of Shares will be made in circumstances which would have or may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of Shares or the financial position of the Company and the Group or result in the Company being delisted.

The revenue of Samurai 2K Aerosol recorded a significant decline by 37.8% from MYR 113.04 million in FY2022 to MYR 70.27 million in FY2023. The decline in revenue was primarily due to the drop in sale in Malaysia and Indonesia markets. Other factors include increase in raw materials, packing materials and ocean freight cost resulting in lower gross profit margin. As a result, the Group incurred a net loss of MYR 11.45 million in FY2023 compared to FY2022 wherein total profit of MYR13.12 million was recorded.STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY SAMURAI 2K AEROSOL

The Group\u2019s loans and advances comprise three borrowers (2021 - three borrowers) that represented 100% (2021 - 100%) of the total loans and advances. There is significant credit risk concentration in a few borrowers.\nIn order to mitigate the concentration of credit risk, the loans and advances are guaranteed by the shareholders of the borrowers and/or Underwriters. The Group and the Company do not hold collateral in respect of its financial asset except for the amounts due from Jetwin where Jetwin grants security over the Properties to the Group. Jetwin agreed to grant security over the Properties to NPIHL, whether by way of caveat or registered mortgage, and not otherwise encumber the Properties as security for repayment of debts. The carrying value of the Properties is $29,313,000 (2021: $31,172,000). The Properties comprise of fully completed apartments and residential apartments under construction. The Properties comprise of fully completed apartments and residential apartments under construction. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each class of financial assets in the statements of financial position.As at 31 December 2022, the Group believes that any reasonably change in the key assumption will not result in a significant impact to the Company.\n(b) Impairment of receivables due from Jetwin\nThe carrying amount of the Group\u2019s receivables due from Jetwin amounted to HK$30,337,000 (2021: HK$34,839,000) as at 31 December 2022. The majority of the assets held by Jetwin is in the form of properties and cash. The majority of the assets held by Jetwin is in the form of properties and cash. Significant application of judgement is required to assess the financial conditions of the counterparty and estimation is involved in determining the fair values of these properties held by Jetwin, as well as establishing the validity and enforceability of the relevant documents and arrangement with Jetwin to use the properties as repayment. The carrying amount of the Group\u2019s receivables due from Jetwin is disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements. Any reasonably change in the key assumption is unlikely to result in a significant impact to the Group as at 31 December 2022.\n(c) Allowance for expected credit loss (\u201cECL\u201d) of loans and advances and other receivables\nAllowance for ECL of loans and advances and other receivables are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the ECL calculation, based on the Group\u2019s past collection history, existing market conditions, current credit standing of debtor as well as forward looking estimates at each reporting date.(b) Control of specified assets and liabilities in Jetwin\nIn accordance with SFRS(I) 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, management has identified specified assets in Jetwin (and related credit enhancements, if any) are the only source of payment for specified liabilities of, or specified other interests in Jetwin. These specified assets and liabilities of the deemed separate entity in Jetwin are the Properties and cash proceeds received under the settlement; and the balances owing to the Group and the other loan provider who is also the controlling shareholder cum director of the Company respectively. Under the Confirmation Letters dated 7 November 2019 and 6 August 2021, Jetwin confirmed and agreed that all the proceeds received under the provision of the 2019 Deed and 2021 Deed and the subsequent sale of the Properties shall be paid to the Group in accordance with the terms and conditions as set out in the original loan agreements between the Group and Jetwin.\nManagement is of the view that the Group has no control over the specified assets and liabilities of the deemed separate entity in Jetwin because:\n(i) The Group has no equity interest in Jetwin; None of the directors or controlling shareholders of the Group is a director or shareholder of Jetwin; The sale, transfer or disposal of any or all of the Properties held by Jetwin at NPIHL\u2019s absolute discretion is to safeguard the recoverability of the debt due from Jetwin; The receipt of net rental income from Jetwin is a form of compensation in place of interest income; and The authority to disburse the funds from the trust accounts held in trust by an Australian law firm is merely a protective right. (ii) (iii)\n(iv) (v)As such, we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to ascertain the completeness of related party disclosures among the Group, the controlling shareholder cum director of the Company, Jetwin and the Australian borrowers.\nFurthermore, management did not involve an independent accounting specialist to perform a retrospective review based on the above information to evaluate whether the Group had control over the specified assets and liabilities of the deemed separate entity in Jetwin in the relevant years as described under \u201cControl of specified assets and liabilities in Jetwin Investment Pty Ltd (\u201cJetwin\u201d)\u201d of the Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion section of our report.

Management is of the view that the Group has no control over the specified assets and liabilities of the deemed separate entity in Jetwin. The Group may be exposed to or has rights to variability in returns from its involvement with the deemed separate entity in Jetwin and affect the amount of the returns due to the following factors:\n(i) As stipulated under the Confirmation Letters, unless and until the amount due by Jetwin are fully repaid to NPIHL, the sale, transfer or disposal of any or all of the Properties held by Jetwin shall only be made with the prior written consent of NPIHL amongst other terms and conditions as specified in the Confirmation Letters, with such consent being at NPIHL\u2019s absolute discretion."], "answer": "The fair value  of the properties held by Jetwin is not explicitly stated in the provided context.", "ground_truth": "The fair value measurement of the properties held by Jetwin is not disclosed in the provided text."}, {"question": "What is the gearing ratio of the Group as at 31 December 2022?", "contexts": ["Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2022\n24 Capital management (Cont\u2019d)\nThe Group HK$\u2019000 HK$\u2019000\n\nOther payables (Note 16) | 5,376 | 8,377\nLease liabilities (Note 17) | \u2013 | 33\nLess: Total cash and cash equivalents (Note 14) | (38,827) | (40,891)\nNet debt #

Our robust business networks and established track record give us the competitive advantage to offer a suite of financing services, including working capital financing via asset-backed loans, as well as mezzanine loans, which are secured by either floating or fixed charge over certain assets or shares of the borrower and/or guaranteed by the major shareholder of the borrower.\nAs we set our sights on a sustainable growth for our financing business, our focus is on optimising our investments in companies that have good fundamentals and growth potential as and when opportunities arise while maintaining a prudent operational approach.Dear Shareholders,\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of Net Pacific Financial Holdings Limited (\u201cNet Pacific\u201d), and together with its subsidiaries (the \u201cGroup\u201d), we are pleased to report on the Group\u2019s business overview and financial performance for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (\u201cFY2022\u201d).\nFY2022 Key Financial Highlights\nFor FY2022, the Group registered a revenue of HK$3.3 million, which is comparable to that recorded for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 (\u201cFY2021\u201d) as the Group\u2019s loan portfolio remained largely unchanged. Other income in FY2021 was higher due to the gain on settlement of the loans to Australian borrowers.\nTotal administrative expenses of the Group was lower in FY2022 compared to FY2021, which was mainly due to higher professional fees incurred in FY2021 as the Group had been seeking advice from the legal advisors and consultants on ways to settle the loans from the Australian borrowers.\nOther expenses in FY2022 comprised mainly the foreign exchange loss arising from the revaluation of the Group\u2019s other receivables denominated in Australian Dollars (\u201cAUD\u201d) as AUD continued to depreciate against HK$ in FY2022.SUSTAINABILITY Report\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2022\nINTRODUCTION\nThis Sustainability Report by Net Pacific Financial Holdings Limited (\u201cNet Pacific\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d, and together with its subsidiaries, the \u201cGroup\u201d) for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (\u201cFY2022\u201d) focuses on the material environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors.

The recoverable amounts of these assets and where applicable, cash- generating units (\u201cCGU\u201d) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of judgements and estimates.\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Group has recognised net impairment losses of $350,000 (2022: $11,000) and $398,000 (2022: $96,000) for plant and equipment and right-of-use assets respectively. If the estimated net profit used in the value-in-use calculation for the relevant assets had been 10% lower than management\u2019s estimates as at 31 March 2023, the Group would have recognised further impairment losses on plant and equipment and right-of-use assets of $66,000 (2022: $53,000) and $76,000 (2022: $211,000) respectively.

When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued pursuant to an employee share option scheme, the cost of treasury shares is reversed from the treasury share account and the realised gain or loss on sale or reissue, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and related income tax, is recognised in the capital reserve.\n2.23 Dividends to Company\u2019s shareholders\nDividends to the Company\u2019s shareholders are recognised when the dividends are approved for payment. 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS\nEstimates, assumptions and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n(i) Impairment of plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\nPlant and equipment and right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any objective evidence or indication that these assets may be impaired. The recoverable amounts of these assets and where applicable, cash- generating units (\u201cCGU\u201d) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.Current and deferred income taxes are recognised as income or expense in profit or loss.\nThe Group accounts for investment tax credits (for example, productivity and innovative credit) similar to accounting for other tax credits where deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax credit can be utilised. 2.17 Provisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\n2.18 Employee compensation\nEmployee benefits are recognised as an expense, unless the cost qualifies to be capitalised as an asset. (a) Defined contribution plans\nDefined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into separate entities such as the Central Provident Fund on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\n(b) Short-term compensated absences\nEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees.

An accrual is made for the estimated liability for unutilised annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date. (c) Profit sharing and bonus plan\nThe Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the Company\u2019s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision when contractually obliged to pay or when there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation to pay.Government grants relating to expenses are shown separately as other income.\nGovernment grants relating to assets are deducted against the carrying amount of the assets.\n2.4 Group accounting\n(a) Subsidiary corporations\n(i) Consolidation\nSubsidiary corporations are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiary corporations are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date on that control ceases.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group entities are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment indicator of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiary corporations have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n(ii) Acquisitions\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations entered into by the Group. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary corporation or business comprises the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred also includes any contingent consideration arrangement and any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary corporation measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred."], "answer": "The fair value of the  employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awarded or granted.

This was attributed mainly to slower demand in plastic injection amidst intense competition from alternative materials and currency exchange losses amidst a weakening Singapore Dollar. Furthermore, manufacturing activity slowed given the continued economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions amidst a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, resulting in weaker customer demand.\nThe market supply of resin, which is a key raw material for the Group\u2019s MBU remained tight throughout FY2023 due to logistics issues exacerbated by labour shortages and rising inflation.MESSAGE CHAIRMAN\u2019S\nDear Shareholders,\nOn behalf of Jubilee\nIndustries Holdings Ltd.\n(\u201cJubilee\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d,\nand together with its\nsubsidiary corporations, the\n\n\u201cGroup\u201d), I am pleased to   present the Group\u2019s latest\nannual report for the financial   year ended 31 March 2023   (\u201cFY2023\u201d).\nUNLOCKING VALUE FOR SHAREHOLDERS\nGlobal economic challenges continue to cast a shadow of uncertainty over the future, as inflationary pressures sparked by rising energy and commodity prices threaten to erode purchasing power.

Ltd.Independent Auditor\u2019s Report\nTo the Members of Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd.\nReport on the Audit of the Financial Statements\nDisclaimer of Opinion\nWe were engaged to audit the financial statements of Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) and its subsidiaries (collectively the \u201cGroup\u201d) which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2023, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\nWe do not express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company.Throughout much of FY2023, strict Covid-19 measures remained in place across China, disrupting economic activity and dampening domestic consumption.\nIn addition, the market supply of resin, which is a key raw material for the MBU remained tight throughout FY2023 due to logistics and labour issues exacerbated by disruption in resin production. Increasing pricing pressures from customers and foreign exchange volatility also present external challenges to the MBU.\nTo mitigate these challenges, the MBU has embarked on several initiatives to improve cost management as well as seeking qualification for alternative sources of raw materials and raising operational efficiencies to mitigate higher raw materials. The MBU also continues to diversify its customer base while expanding its product offering with higher margins.\nIn addition, we believe that through synergies with Optium, HF \u2013 MBU will have access to new customers, deeper expertise and stronger financial resources to thrive in the long term.\nMESSAGE CHAIRMAN\u2019S\nOn a positive note, the MBU\u2019s mould design and fabrication services business remains robust with new orders received from various industry segments.

Any amount in revaluation reserve relating to that asset is transferred to retained earnings directly. No transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings except when an asset is derecognised.\n(o) Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately. The intangible asset pertains to customer relationship acquired through acquisition of a subsidiary. It is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life.

If such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use) of the asset is estimated to determine the amount of impairment loss.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing of these assets, recoverable amount is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets.

The directors of the Company have assessed that the going concern basis of preparation for this set of financial statements remains appropriate due to:\n(i) The Group has sufficient cash to fund the operations of the Group as the Group has net current assets of S$20,933,000 (2022: S$19,390,000) as at 31 March 2023; and\n(ii) On 29 August 2023, the Company has completed the disposal of an 86% equity interest in a subsidiary corporation, WE Components Pte.

Trade receivables\nThe Group uses a provision matrix to measure the lifetime expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. In measuring the expected credit losses (\u201cECL\u201d), trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and days past due.The provision matrix is initially based on the Group\u2019s historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, historical default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECL is a significant estimate. The amount of ECL is sensitive to changes in circumstances. The forecast economic conditions and the Group\u2019s historical credit loss experience may also not be representative of the customer\u2019s actual default in the future. The information about the ECL on the Group\u2019s trade receivables are disclosed in Note 32(a)(iv) to the financial statements.\n(b) Inventories written-down\nAs at 31 March 2023, the carrying amount of inventory is S$659,000 (2022: S$19,017,000). Management estimates the net realisable values of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The future realisation of these inventories may be affected by future technology or other market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. Based on the assessment, there was no write-down of inventories during the current financial year (2022: write-down of S$1,965,000).OPERATIONS AND\nCash Flow Statement\nNet cash generated from operating activities for FY2023 was S$1.3 million, reversing the net cash used from operating activities of S$2.7 million recorded for FY2022. The reversal was mainly due to movement in inventory level.\nNet cash generated from investing activities of S$11.7 million for FY2023 was mainly due to proceeds from the disposal of investments in financial assets at FVPL and partial disposal of subsidiary. Net cash used in financing activities for FY2023 was S$3.7 million which was attributed to the repayment of bank borrowings and loan from non-related party.\nAs a result of the above, the Group\u2019s cash and cash equivalents increased by S$9.3 million from S$4.1 million as at 31 March 2022 to S$13.4 million as at 31 March 2023.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW"], "answer": "1, 329", "ground_truth": "S$1,329,000"}, {"question": "What is the net carrying amount of the investment in subsidiary corporations as of 31 March 2023?", "contexts": ["Notes to the Financial Statements\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2023\n20 Investment in Subsidiary Corporations\n\nCompany | \n2023 | 2022\nUnquoted equity shares, at cost\n\nAt 1 April | 74,766 | 74,766\nPartial disposal of subsidiary (Note a) | (4,852) | \u2013\nAt 31 March | 69,914 | 74,766\nLess: Allowance for impairment loss\n\nAt 1 April | 49,516 | 35, 516 | 35,110\n(Reversal of )/Addition to impairment losses (Note b) | (5,938) | 14,406\nAt 31 March | 43,578 | 49,516\nNet carrying amount\n\nAs at 31 March | 26,336 | 25, 516\nNet carrying amount\n\nAs at 31 March | 26,336 | 25,250\nDetails of subsidiary corporations at the end of the reporting period are as follows:\n\n |  | Percentage of effective\nName of subsidiary/ Country of |  | equity interest held by\nincorporation | Principal activities | the Company   2023   2022\n\n |  |  |  | % | %\nHeld by the Company\n\nJubilee Industries (S) Pte.

For trade receivables, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit history and obtaining cash deposits where appropriate to mitigate credit risk. For other financial assets, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with high credit quality counterparties.\nCredit exposure to an individual counterparty is restricted by credit limits that are approved by the management based on ongoing credit evaluation.

Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-months ECL at initial recognition.\nAt each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group and the Company consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group\u2019s and the Company\u2019s historical experience and informed credit assessment. If credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-months ECLs\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Group performed an assessment of impairment using the 12-months ECL basis on these financial assets.

(\u201cJubilee\u201d and together with its subsidiary corporations, the \u201cGroup\u201d) recorded a revenue of S$22.4 million from continuing operation relating only to the Mechanical Business Unit (\u201cMBU\u201d), a decrease of S$8.0 million or 26.3% as compared to S$30.4 million for the financial year ended 31 March 2022 (\u201cFY2022\u201d). This was attributed mainly to slower demand in plastic injection amidst intense competition from alternative materials and currency exchange losses amidst a weakening Singapore Dollar. Furthermore, manufacturing activity slowed given the continued economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions amidst a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, resulting in weaker customer demand.\nThe market supply of resin, which is a key raw material for the Group\u2019s MBU remained tight throughout FY2023 due to logistics issues exacerbated by labour shortages and rising inflation.Independent Auditor\u2019s Report\nTo the Members of Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd.

Our largest revenue-generating segment, Singapore, contributed significantly to the overall increase with a revenue growth of S$3.9 million. Furthermore, our operations in Malaysia and China also experienced a revenue growth of S$0.7 million, generated primarily from our operations at ECON Medicare Centre and Nursing Home in Puchong, Malaysia and Chongqing.\nECON Healthcare\u2019s financial position remains robust, with cash and cash equivalents amounting to S$24.6 million as of 31 March 2023.ORGANISATION CHART\nECON HEALTHCARE (ASIA) LIMITED\n\nECON Medicare Centre |  |  | ECON Careskill Training\nPte Ltd   Singapore | 100% | 100% | Centre (ECTC) Pte.

Sustainability-related risks, as the significant ESG risks, were also covered by our ERM Framework. We proceeded with the risk assessment through identification, analysis and evaluation processes.

These risks and opportunities were then ranked based on their potential impact on the Group\u2019s operations.\nClimate-related risks will be reviewed and reported annually to the Audit and Risk Management Committee (\u201cARMC\u201d) and the Board.

While the past year saw border restrictions around the world lifting with more people freely travelling again, and economies starting to normalise, the real estate industry nonetheless continued to experience headwinds due to disruptive global geopolitical tensions that have led to greater inflation, high interest rates, increased development costs and uncertain economic conditions.\nAlthough faced with difficulties, the Group remains dedicated to delivering top-notch products and had persisted in generating innovative ideas and producing superior quality products so as to provide the best value propositions to both our customers and the Company.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended March 31, 2023\n28 OPERATING SEGMENTS (CONT\u2019D)\n\nProperty | Investment |  | \ndevelopment |

This growth was partially supported by the private residential property segment. However, with higher borrowing and construction costs, a projected weak economic growth, slower growth in Housing and Development Board (\u201cHDB\u201d) resale prices and the recent cooling measures, private residential prices are expected to rise only moderately this financial year.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nOn behalf of the Board and Management, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Mr Chng for his contributions during his tenure as a member of the Board, and our esteemed customers, shareholders, strategic partners, and our staff for their unwavering commitment and trust.

The subsequent measurement category is dependent on the Group\u2019s business model for managing the asset and cash flow characteristics of the asset:\nAmortised cost\nThe Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\nThe financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial\nassets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\uf06c\nThe contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. \uf06c\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the e\ufb00ective interest rate (\u201cEIR\u201d) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in interest income using the EIR method.1 million increase in travelling expenses and S$0.2 million decrease in general and administrative expenses of the Group\u2019s subsidiaries.\nAn increase in income tax expense of S$2.4 million due to S$0.7 million tax provisions of Group\u2019s subsidiaries in FY23 and a decrease of S$1.7 million tax credit from FY22 and none in FY23. The tax credits in FY22 arise from write backs of deferred tax liabilities pertaining to the distribution and licensing rights of China subsidiaries. As at 30 April 2023, the Total Assets of the Group were S$100.2 million (FY22: S$117.4 million). The Net Current Liabilities of the Group as at 30 April 2023 were S$10.0 million (FY22: S$14.3 million), of which S$12.7 million (FY22: S$16.6 million) was held as cash and cash equivalents. The Group\u2019s total borrowings of S$22.5 million (FY22: S$22.2 million) consist of mainly bank loans and overdrafts obtained by subsidiaries in PRC and ESA. The Group\u2019s gearing ratio as at 30 April 2023, based on net debt divided by total capital is 0.41 times (FY22: 0.33 times). Net debt is calculated as total borrowings, lease liabilities and trade and other payables less cash and cash equivalents.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont\u2019d)\n2.13 Financial assets (cont\u2019d)\nImpairment\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (\u201cECLs\u201d) for financial assets carried at amortised cost. ECLs are based on the di\ufb00erence between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original e\ufb00ective interest rate. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a \u201c12-month ECL\u201d). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a \u201clifetime ECL\u201d). For trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component, the Group applies a simplified approach to recognise a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.

Key audit matter\nFair values of investment properties\nAs at 31 March 2023, the carrying amount of investment properties was HK$53,430,054,000. Fair value gains on investment properties amounting to HK$151,588,000 were recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year then ended. The Group engaged an external valuation expert to perform valuations of the Group\u2019s investment properties to estimate their fair values as at 31 March 2023. The fair values of investment properties were determined principally using the income capitalisation method by capitalising the rental income derived from the existing tenancies with due provisions for the reversionary income potential of the properties. The determination of application of the valuation technique, future rental income and rental rate involved significant management judgement and estimates.\nThe related disclosures are included in notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\nOur audit procedures included evaluating the valuation process and the independence and expertise of the external valuation expert.447 | 977,068   896,447\nFinancial assets included in prepayments,   other receivables and other assets   Amount due from a related party | \u8a08\u5165\u9810\u4ed8\u6b3e\u9805\u3001\u5176\u4ed6\u61c9\u6536\u6b3e\u9805   \u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u8cc7\u7522\u4e4b\u91d1\u878d\u8cc7\u7522   \u61c9\u6536\u95dc\u9023\u516c\u53f8\u6b3e\u9805 | \u2013   \u2013 | 1,481,862   143,541 | 1,481,862   143, 481,862   143,541 | 1,481,862   143,541\nFinancial assets at fair value through   profit or loss   Cash and bank balances | \u900f\u904e\u640d\u76ca\u4ee5\u516c\u5e73\u503c\u5217\u8cec\u4e4b\u91d1\u878d   \u8cc7\u7522   \u73fe\u91d1\u53ca\u9280\u884c\u5b58\u6b3e | 5,668   \u2013 | \u2013   2,525,074 | 5,668   2,525,074\n\u91d1\u878d\u8ca0\u50b5 Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities   at fair value   through Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities   at fair value   through profit   or loss   \u900f\u904e\u640d\u76ca\u4ee5\u516c\u5e73\u503c   \u5217\u8cec\u4e4b\u91d1\u878d\u8ca0\u50b5   Mandatorily Financial liabilities   designated   measured at | \nas such   amortised cost   \u6309\u6524\u92b7\u6210\u672c | Total\n\u5f37\u5236\u6307\u5b9a\u70ba   \u8a08\u91cf\u4e4b\u91d1\u878d\u8ca0\u50b5 | \u7e3d\u8a08\nHK$\u2019000   HK$\u2019000Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)\n\u8ca1\u52d9\u5831\u8868\u9644\u8a3b\uff08\u7e8c\uff09\n31 March 2023 2023\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\n\n43.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and\nPolicies\nThe Group\u2019s principal financial instruments comprise bank and other borrowings, senior notes, medium-term notes, domestic company bonds and cash and short-term deposits.

The Group has various other financial assets such as trade receivables, which arise directly from its operations.

The interest rates and terms of repayment of the Group\u2019s borrowings are disclosed in notes 29, 30, 31 and 32 to the financial statements. The Group\u2019s policy is to obtain the most favourable interest rates available for its borrowings. The Group\u2019s policy is to obtain the most favourable interest rates available for its borrowings.\nThe Group constantly assesses the interest rate risk it encounters to decide whether it is required to hedge against the possible interest rate risk that may arise.\nOn 31 March 2023, if the interest rate of bank borrowings had increased/decreased by 0.5% and all other factors remained unchanged, the profit after tax for the year of the Group would have decreased/increased by approximately HK$7,561,000 (2022: HK$39,348,000).\n45.The main risks arising from the Group\u2019s financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk.

Please see pages 90 to 91 for more information on AA REIT's stakeholder engagement efforts.\nTransition risks arise from the process of shifting towards a low-carbon economy, and can include regulatory changes, disruptive technological developments, and shifts in consumer and investor preferences. Physical risks arise from the impact of weather events and long-term or widespread environmental changes and can include increased severity of extreme weather events such as floods, rising mean temperatures, sea levels and weather patterns. 4 5"], "answer": "The main principle established  to address potential conflicts of interest which may arise in managing AA REIT is that the Manager is dedicated to managing AA REIT and will not directly or indirectly manage other real  estate investment trusts. investment trusts.", "ground_truth": "The Manager is dedicated to managing AA REIT and will not directly or indirectly manage other real estate investment trusts."}, {"question": "What are the various fees earned by the Manager of AA REIT?", "contexts": ["CORPOR ATE GOVERNANCE\nFees payable to the Manager\nPursuant to the Trust Deed, the Manager is entitled to receive fees payable out of the deposited property of AA REIT.\nThe methodology for the computation of the fees is disclosed on page 164 under the \u201cNotes to the Financial Statements\u201d section of this Annual Report.\nThe management fees are earned by the Manager for the management of AA REIT\u2019s portfolio of properties.

The various fees earned by the Manager are further elaborated below:\n(i) Base fee\nThe Manager is responsible for the ongoing management of the assets and liabilities of AA REIT for the benefit of the Unitholders. Accordingly, the Manager should be fairly compensated for its efforts in the overall management of AA REIT and it should enable the Manager to cover its operational, administrative and compliance overheads incurred in the management of the portfolio. The base management fee is calculated as a percentage of the Deposited Property (as defined in the Trust Deed) of AA REIT as it provides an appropriate metric to determine the resources required for managing the assets. As AA REIT grows its portfolio size, the complexity of management increases and the Manager is expected to expend greater effort in fulfilling its responsibilities.\n(ii) Performance fee\nThe performance fee is only payable when the Manager has achieved certain levels of growth in the Distribution per Unit (\u201cDPU\u201d) in the current financial year relative to the previous financial year.The various fees earned by the Manager are further elaborated below:\n(i) Base fee\nThe Manager is responsible for the ongoing management of the assets and liabilities of AA REIT for the benefit of the Unitholders.

As the year-on-year growth of the DPU is in line with the interests of the Unitholders, the performance fee will spur the Manager to seek growth opportunities or embark on cost savings initiatives to improve the performance of AA REIT. The performance fee is calculated as a percentage of the Deposited Property (as defined in the Trust Deed) of AA REIT as it provides an appropriate metric to determine the resources required for such efforts taken to achieve the growth in DPU and aligns the interests of the Manager with Unitholders.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nINTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\nThe transactions entered into with interested persons during the financial year which fall under the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST and the Property Funds Appendix under the Code on Collective Investment Schemes are:\n\n |  |  | Aggregate value   of all interested\n |  | Aggregate value   of all interested   person transactions   during the financial   year under   review (excluding   transactions less   than S$100,000) | person transactions   conducted under   Unitholders\u2019   mandate   pursuant to Rule   920 (excluding   transactions less   than S$100, 000)\nName of Interested Person | Nature of relationship | S$\u2019000 | S$\u2019000\nAIMS APAC REIT Management Limited\n\n\u2013 Manager\u2019s base management fees | REIT Manager | 11,333 | \u2013\n\u2013 Manager\u2019s performance fees |  | 4,476 | \u2013\nAIMS APAC Property Management Pte.

In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.\nThe Group has an option to apply a \u2018concentration test\u2019 that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\nThe Group measures goodwill at the date of acquisition as:\n\n\u2022\nthe consideration transferred (generally measured at fair value); plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree,\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\nover the net recognised amount (generally measured at fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.The measurement basis taken is elected for each business combination.

The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\nThe accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non- controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have deficit balance. Joint venture\nA joint venture is an entity over which the Group has joint control established by contractual arrangement, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\nInvestment in a joint venture is accounted for under the equity method and is recognised initially at cost.

Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\nCredit-impaired financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit- impaired. A financial asset is \u2018credit-impaired\u2019 when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n\u2022\nsignificant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due; the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise; it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group\u2019s historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.\nIf credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs. The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\n\u2022\nthe borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.\n\n\u2022\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\nMeasurement of ECLs\nECLs are probability-weighted estimates or credit losses.

The Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.\n\t\tFinancial liabilities\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the statement of total return.NOTES TO THE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear ended 31 March 2023\n3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont\u2019d) 3.6\nImpairment (cont\u2019d) (i)\nNon-derivative financial assets (cont\u2019d)\nWrite-off\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group\u2019s procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n(ii) Joint venture\nAn impairment loss in respect of a joint venture is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with note 3.6(iii). An impairment is recognised in the statement of total return. An impairment is recognised in the statement of total return. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n(iii) Non-financial assets\nThe carrying amounts of the Group\u2019s non-financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (\u201cCGU\u201d) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.Other non-trading derivatives\nWhen a derivative financial instrument is not designated in a hedge relationship that qualifies for hedge accounting, all changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in the statement of total return.\n3.6 Impairment (i)\nNon-derivative financial assets\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (\u201cECLs\u201d) on financial assets measured at amortised cost.\nLease receivables are disclosed as part of trade and other receivables.

The simplified approach requires the loss allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.\nGeneral approach\nThe Group applies the general approach to provide for ECLs on all other financial instruments.

Under the contracts, the Group pays fixed interest rates of 0.280% to 3.313% (31 March 2022: 0.280% to 3.313%) per annum and receives interest at the three-month SORA or BBSY (31 March 2022: three- month SOR, SORA or BBSY).The Manager manages the cash flow interest rate risks of these variable rate financial liabilities using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps or via fixed rates borrowings.\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Group had interest rate swap contracts with total notional amounts of $172.0 million and AUD478.5 million, equivalent to approximately $426.6 million (31 March 2022: $202.0 million and AUD478.5 million, equivalent to approximately $484.8 million).

The Group\u2019s main IBOR exposure in previous year was indexed to SOR. In Singapore, the Steering Committee for SOR and SIBOR transition to SORA (SC-STS) together with the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee (SFEMC), has recommended the discontinuation of SOR and a shift towards the use of SORA as the alternative interest rate benchmark in Singapore. The timeline for SORA to replace SOR is by the end of June 2023.(i) Interest rate risk\nThe Manager adopts a proactive interest rate management policy to manage the risk associated with adverse movement in interest rates on the loan facilities while also seeking to ensure that the Group\u2019s cost of debt remains competitive. The policy aims to protect the Group\u2019s earnings from the volatility in interest rates and provide stability to Unitholders\u2019 returns.\nCash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of the changes in market interest rates. The Group\u2019s and Trust\u2019s exposure to cash flow interest rate risks arise mainly from variable rate financial liabilities. The Manager manages the cash flow interest rate risks of these variable rate financial liabilities using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps or via fixed rates borrowings.\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Group had interest rate swap contracts with total notional amounts of $172.0 million and AUD478.5 million, equivalent to approximately $426.6 million (31 March 2022: $202.0 million and AUD478.5 million, equivalent to approximately $484.8 million).

As at 31 March 2023, the Group had designated the interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts of $172.0 million and AUD478.5 million, equivalent to approximately $426.6 million (31 March 2022 $75.0 million and AUD325.0 million, equivalent to approximately $329.3 million), as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge to hedge against variable interest payment arising from the floating rate loans."], "answer": "$426. 6 million", "ground_truth": "$426.6 million"}, {"question": "What is the total lease receivables for the Group as of 31 March 2023?", "contexts": ["Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility.

The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control. The Group has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $52.7 million as at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: $59.3 million).\nLeases as lessor\nThe Group leases out its investment properties (see note 4).
